(WITH U. HOADLEY AND A. SOLOVYEVA) WHILE MANY LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN ACCESS TO EDUCATION, THIS PROGRESS HAS NOT YET BEEN MATCHED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. THE RESEARCH REPORTED IN THIS PAPER EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF THE READ LIBERIA INTERVENTION, A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDED TEACHER TRAINING AND COACHING, TEACHING AND LEARNING MATERIALS, AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH, AND REACHED 57,600 STUDENTS IN GRADE 1 AND 2 IN 640 SCHOOLS. WE EXPLOITED THE RANDOMIZED ASSIGNMENT OF SCHOOLS TO THE PROGRAM AND FOUND A LARGE POSITIVE EFFECT ON STUDENTS' ABILITY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND GRADE-APPROPRIATE TEXT. LITERACY (ORAL READING FLUENCY AND ORAL READING COMPREHENSION) AMONG STUDENTS IN THE TREATMENT SCHOOLS DOUBLED, ON AVERAGE, COMPARED TO THE CONTROL SCHOOLS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION DATA, WE ARGUE THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN READING PERFORMANCE ARE DRIVEN BY THE AVAILABILITY AND UTILIZATION OF READ LIBERIA READING MATERIALS AND NOT BY IMPROVED TEACHING PRACTICES AT SCHOOLS. THIS CONFIRMS RESEARCH LITERATURE SUGGESTING IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS LITERATURE, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HIGH-QUALITY, AND WELL-LEVELED LEARNING MATERIALS IN THE HANDS OF STUDENTS MAY HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON READING SKILLS INDEPENDENT OF CHANGES IN INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICE.   (WITH ALEJANDRO OME)  EDUCATION ECONOMICS WE EVALUATE AN INTERVENTION USING SMS MESSAGING TO SEND SHORT STORIES TO 2ND AND 3RD GRADERS IN ZAMBIA’S EASTERN PROVINCE, AIMED AT IMPROVING READING SKILLS.

BOOKS SHAPE HOW CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT SOCIETY AND NORMS, IN PART THROUGH REPRESENTATION OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERS. WE USE COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS TO CHARACTERIZE REPRESENTATION IN CHILDREN’S BOOKS WIDELY READ IN HOMES, CLASSROOMS, AND LIBRARIES OVER THE LAST CENTURY, AND DESCRIBE ECONOMIC FORCES THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THESE PATTERNS. WE INTRODUCE NEW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS FOR SYSTEMATICALLY CONVERTING IMAGES INTO DATA. WE APPLY THESE TOOLS, ALONGSIDE TEXT ANALYSIS METHODS, TO MEASURE SKIN COLOR, RACE, GENDER, AND AGE IN THE CONTENT OF THESE BOOKS, DOCUMENTING WHAT HAS CHANGED AND WHAT HAS ENDURED OVER TIME. WE FIND UNDERREPRESENTATION OF BLACK AND LATINX PEOPLE IN THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BOOKS, RELATIVE TO THEIR POPULATION SHARES, THOUGH REPRESENTATION OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS INCREASES OVER TIME. FEMALES ARE ALSO INCREASINGLY PRESENT BUT APPEAR LESS OFTEN IN TEXT THAN IN IMAGES, SUGGESTING GREATER SYMBOLIC INCLUSION IN PICTURES THAN SUBSTANTIVE INCLUSION IN STORIES. CHARACTERS IN THESE INFLUENTIAL BOOKS HAVE LIGHTER AVERAGE SKIN COLOR THAN IN OTHER BOOKS, EVEN AFTER CONDITIONING ON RACE, AND CHILDREN ARE DEPICTED WITH LIGHTER SKIN COLOR THAN ADULTS ON AVERAGE. WE THEN PRESENT EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF RELATED ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE REPRESENTATION WE FIND IN THESE BOOKS. ON THE DEMAND SIDE, WE SHOW THAT PEOPLE CONSUME BOOKS THAT CENTER THEIR OWN IDENTITIES, AND THAT THE TYPES OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS PURCHASED CORRELATE WITH LOCAL POLITICAL BELIEFS. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, WE DOCUMENT HIGHER PRICES FOR BOOKS THAT CENTER NON-DOMINANT SOCIAL IDENTITIES AND FEWER COPIES OF THESE BOOKS IN LIBRARIES THAT SERVE PREDOMINANTLY WHITE COMMUNITIES.  [REPLICATION FILES]         [SLIDES]         [TWITTER THREAD]         [RESEARCH BRIEF]         [AI RESEARCH BRIEF (SSN)]         [VIDEO]         [POSTER]         [INTERACTIVE FIGURES]         [GOOGLE CASE STUDY]        [BROOKINGS CHALKBOARD]         [IZA ARTICLE]       [PRESS: TIME MAGAZINE, SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL, WALL STREET JOURNAL, CODE TOGETHER, INEQUALITALKS, FUTUREED, THE 74, PARENTDATA, NEW YORK TIMES, THE ECONOMIST]         [RECOGNITION: NAMED ONE OF THE TEN MOST SIGNIFICANT EDUCATION STUDIES OF 2021 BY GEORGE LUCAS FOUNDATION'S EDUTOPIA, RECEIVED THE 2021 EARLY CAREER AWARD FROM THE EDUCATION POLICY COLLABORATIVE, RECEIVED THE FIRST PLACE POSTER PRIZE AT APPAM 2021, RECEIVED THE 2021 GOOGLE CUSTOMER AWARD FOR EDUCATION AND THE 2021 GOOGLE CUSTOMER AWARD FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION, RECEIVED THE 2023 MINDBYTES DATA VISUALIZATION AWARD, FEATURED ON BEST OF #ECONTWITTER] ""FROM RETRIBUTIVE TO RESTORATIVE: AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO JUSTICE"" (WITH B.

ASHER Ⓡ K. JHA Ⓡ P. NOVOSAD Ⓡ B. TAN) (JUNE 2023, WORKING PAPER)
RAPID URBANIZATION IN LOWER-INCOME COUNTRIES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL-BEING, BUT THE RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION OF MARGINALIZED GROUPS COULD REINFORCE INEQUALITY AND LIMIT ACCESS TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES. WE STUDY RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION, ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES, AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES ACROSS 1.5 MILLION URBAN AND RURAL NEIGHBORHOODS FOR TWO OF INDIA’S MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES: SCHEDULED CASTES (SCS) AND MUSLIMS. LEVELS OF URBAN SEGREGATION IN INDIA ARE COMPARABLE TO BLACK/WHITE SEGREGATION IN THE UNITED STATES. WITHIN CITIES, PUBLIC FACILITIES AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE ARE SYSTEMATICALLY ALLOCATED AWAY FROM NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE MANY MUSLIMS AND SCHEDULES CASTES LIVE. NEARLY ALL OF THE REGRESSIVE ALLOCATION IS ACROSS NEIGHBORHOODS WITHIN CITIES—AT THE MOST INFORMAL AND LEAST STUDIED FORM OF GOVERNMENT. THESE INEQUALITIES ARE ALSO NOT VISIBLE IN THE MORE AGGREGATED DATA TYPICALLY USED TO STUDY UNEQUAL SERVICE ALLOCATION. CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS GROWING UP IN MARGINALIZED GROUP NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE LESS SCHOOLING, EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR PARENT EDUCATION AND HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION. UNEQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES IN INDIA’S HIGHLY SEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOODS MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO DISADVANTAGES FACED BY MARGINALIZED GROUPS.   [SUMMARY]         [FACT SHEET]         [TWITTER SUMMARY]        [PRESS: THE WIRE, THE INDIAN EXPRESS, THE PRINT, GK TODAY, COUNTERVIEW, HINDUSTAN TIMES, ARTICLE14] ""TALES AND TROPES: GENDER ROLES FROM WORD EMBEDDINGS IN A CENTURY OF CHILDREN’S BOOKS"" (WITH P.

THE MANNER IN WHICH GENDER IS PORTRAYED IN MATERIALS USED TO TEACH CHILDREN CONVEYS MESSAGES ABOUT PEOPLE’S ROLES IN SOCIETY. IN THIS PAPER, WE MEASURE THE GENDERED DEPICTION OF CENTRAL DOMAINS OF SOCIAL LIFE IN 100 YEARS OF HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL CHILDREN’S BOOKS. WE MAKE TWO MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS: (1) WE FIND THAT THE PORTRAYAL OF GENDER IN THESE BOOKS REPRODUCES TRADITIONAL GENDER NORMS IN SOCIETY, AND (2) WE PUBLISH STORYWORDS 1.0, THE FIRST WORD EMBEDDINGS TRAINED ON SUCH A LARGE BODY OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. WE FIND THAT, RELATIVE TO MALES, FEMALES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE REPRESENTED IN RELATION TO THEIR APPEARANCE THAN IN RELATION TO THEIR COMPETENCE; SECOND, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE REPRESENTED IN RELATION TO THEIR ROLE IN THE FAMILY THAN THEIR ROLE IN BUSINESS. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT NON-BINARY OR GENDER-FLUID INDIVIDUALS ARE RARELY MENTIONED. OUR ANALYSIS ADVANCES UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENT MESSAGES CONTAINED IN CONTENT COMMONLY USED TO TEACH CHILDREN, WITH IMMEDIATE APPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE, POLICY, AND RESEARCH.

RAJ) (JUNE 2022, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM SIGCAS/SIGCHI CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING AND SUSTAINABLE SOCIETIES (ACM COMPASS '22))
THE WAY THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT IDENTITIES ARE PORTRAYED IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS CAN SEND SUBCONSCIOUS MESSAGES ABOUT HOW POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY CHILDREN SHOULD THINK ABOUT PEOPLE WITH THOSE IDENTITIES. THESE MESSAGES CAN THEN SHAPE THE NEXT GENERATION'S PERCEPTIONS AND ATTITUDES ABOUT PEOPLE, WHICH CAN HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR BELIEF FORMATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE MAKE TWO CONTRIBUTIONS: (1) WE EXAMINE THE DEPICTION OF RACE AND GENDER IN AWARD-WINNING CHILDREN'S BOOKS FROM THE LAST CENTURY, AND (2) WE EXAMINE HOW CONSUMPTION OF THESE BOOKS RELATES TO LOCAL BELIEFS. FIRST, WE ANALYZE THE SENTIMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAMOUS INDIVIDUALS MENTIONED IN THESE BOOKS. WHILE THE SENTIMENT SURROUNDING WOMEN IS POSITIVE OVERALL, ON AVERAGE, WE SEE THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE MORE OFTEN PORTRAYED WITH NEGATIVE SENTIMENT IN MAINSTREAM BOOKS, WHILE WHITE WOMEN ARE MORE OFTEN PORTRAYED WITH POSITIVE SENTIMENT. BECAUSE CHILDREN'S BOOKS IN THE US DEPICT MORE WHITE WOMEN OVERALL, THIS DISGUISES THE MORE NEGATIVE INTERSECTIONAL PORTRAYALS OF BLACK WOMEN. BOOKS THAT CENTER UNDERREPRESENTED IDENTITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO PORTRAY ALL CHARACTERS WITH MORE POSITIVE SENTIMENT. A CENTURY AGO, WOMEN WERE MUCH LESS POSITIVELY SPOKEN ABOUT THAN MEN, BUT THE AVERAGE SENTIMENT OF FEMALES AND MALES HAS CONVERGED OVER TIME. THE DIFFERENCE IN SENTIMENT CONNECTED WITH BLACK PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE HAS ALSO DECREASED OVER TIME, BUT THERE STILL REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL GAP. SECOND, WE THEN ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOOK PURCHASES AND LOCAL BELIEFS TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL MESSAGES BEING TRANSMITTED TO CHILDREN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF SOCIETY. WE SEE THAT MORE PURCHASES OF BOOKS WITH POSITIVE SENTIMENT TOWARDS BLACK CHARACTERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGER PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THAT WHITE PEOPLE IN THE U.S. HAVE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN AND WHO ARE ANGRY THAT RACISM EXISTS. UNDERSTANDING THE MESSAGES THAT MAY BE IMPLICITLY -- OR EXPLICITLY -- SENT TO CHILDREN THROUGH HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL BOOKS CAN LEND INSIGHT INTO THE FACTORS THAT MAY SHAPE CHILDREN'S BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES.   [VIDEO] ""MEASURING REPRESENTATION OF RACE, GENDER, AND AGE IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS: FACE DETECTION AND FEATURE CLASSIFICATION IN ILLUSTRATED IMAGES"" (WITH T. SZASZ, E. HARRISON, P-J. LIU, P-C. LIN, H.B. RUNESHA) (JANUARY 2022, PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE/CVF WINTER CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER VISION (WACV))
IMAGES IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS CONVEY MESSAGES ABOUT SOCIETY AND THE ROLES THAT PEOPLE PLAY IN IT. UNDERSTANDING THESE MESSAGES REQUIRES SYSTEMATIC MEASUREMENT OF WHO IS REPRESENTED. COMPUTER VISION FACE DETECTION TOOLS CAN PROVIDE SUCH MEASUREMENTS; HOWEVER, STATE-OF-THE-ART FACE DETECTION MODELS WERE TRAINED WITH PHOTOGRAPHS, AND 80\% OF IMAGES IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE ILLUSTRATED; THUS EXISTING METHODS BOTH MISCLASSIFY AND MISS CLASSIFYING MANY FACES. IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE A NEW APPROACH TO ANALYZE IMAGES USING AI TOOLS, RESULTING IN DATA THAT CAN ASSESS REPRESENTATION OF RACE, GENDER, AND AGE IN BOTH ILLUSTRATIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS IN CHILDREN’S BOOKS. WE MAKE FOUR PRIMARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELDS OF DEEP LEARNING AND SOCIAL SCIENCES: (1) WE CURATE AN ORIGINAL FACE DETECTION DATA SET (ILLUSFACE 1.0) BY MANUALLY LABELING 5,403 ILLUSTRATED FACES WITH BOUNDING BOXES. (2) WE TRAIN TWO AUTOML-BASED FACE DETECTION MODELS FOR ILLUSTRATIONS: (I) USING ILLUSFACE 1.0 (FDAI); (II) USING ICARTOON, A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA SET (FDAI_IC), EACH OPTIMIZED FOR ILLUSTRATED IMAGES, DETECTING 2.5 TIMES MORE FACES IN OUR TESTING DATA THAN THE ESTABLISHED FACE DETECTOR USING GOOGLE VISION (FDGV). (3) WE CURATE A DATA SET OF THE RACE, GENDER, AND AGE OF 980 FACES MANUALLY LABELED BY THREE DIFFERENT RATERS (CBFEATURES 1.0). (4) WE TRAIN AN AUTOML FEATURE CLASSIFICATION MODEL (FCA) USING CBFEATURES 1.0. WE COMPARE FCA WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ANOTHER AUTOML MODEL THAT WE TRAINED ON UTKFACE, A PUBLIC DATA SET (FCA_UTK) AND OF AN ESTABLISHED MODEL USING FAIRFACE (FCF). FINALLY, WE EXAMINE DISTRIBUTIONS OF CHARACTER IDENTITIES OVER THE LAST CENTURY ACROSS THE MODELS. WE FIND THAT FCA IS 34% MORE ACCURATE THAN FCF IN ITS RACE PREDICTIONS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDE TOOLS TO EDUCATORS, CAREGIVERS, AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPERS TO ASSESS THE REPRESENTATION CONTAINED IN CHILDREN'S CONTENT.    [POSTER]    [VIDEO] ""SANITATION AND EDUCATION"" (APRIL 2017, AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS)
I EXPLORE WHETHER THE ABSENCE OF SCHOOL-SANITATION INFRASTRUCTURE IMPEDES EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, PARTICULARLY AMONG PUBESCENT-AGE GIRLS, USING A NATIONAL INDIAN SCHOOL LATRINE-CONSTRUCTION INITIATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCHOOL-LEVEL DATA. SCHOOL-LATRINE CONSTRUCTION SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES ENROLLMENT OF PUBESCENT-AGE GIRLS, THOUGH PREDOMINATELY WHEN PROVIDING SEX-SPECIFIC LATRINES. PRIVACY AND SAFETY APPEAR TO MATTER SUFFICIENTLY FOR PUBESCENT-AGE GIRLS THAT ONLY SEX-SPECIFIC LATRINES REDUCE GENDER DISPARITIES.

(WITH S. ASHER AND P. NOVOSAD) (JANUARY 2020, AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS)
THE RURAL POOR IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, ONCE ECONOMICALLY ISOLATED, ARE INCREASINGLY BEING CONNECTED TO OUTSIDE MARKETS. WHETHER THESE NEW CONNECTIONS CROWD OUT OR ENCOURAGE EDUCATIONAL INVESTMENT IS A CENTRAL QUESTION. WE EXAMINE THE IMPACTS ON EDUCATIONAL CHOICES OF 115,000 NEW ROADS BUILT UNDER INDIA'S FLAGSHIP ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. WE FIND THAT CHILDREN STAY IN SCHOOL LONGER AND PERFORM BETTER ON STANDARDIZED EXAMS. TREATMENT HETEROGENEITY SUPPORTS THE PREDICTIONS OF A STANDARD HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENT MODEL: ENROLLMENT INCREASES ARE LARGEST WHERE NEARBY LABOR MARKETS OFFER THE HIGHEST RETURNS TO EDUCATION AND LOWEST WHERE THEY IMPLY HIGH OPPORTUNITY COSTS OF SCHOOLING.   [SLIDES] ""SPILLOVER IMPACTS ON EDUCATION FROM EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEES"" (JANUARY 2022, EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY)
PROGRAMS THAT GUARANTEE SOME BASIC LEVEL OF LOW-SKILL EMPLOYMENT ARE A POPULAR ANTI-POVERTY STRATEGY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WITH INDIA'S EMPLOYMENT-GUARANTEE PROGRAM (MGNREGA) ANNUALLY EMPLOYING ADULTS IN 23% OF INDIAN HOUSEHOLDS.  AN IMPORTANT CONCERN IS THESE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS MAY DISCOURAGE CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND, THUS, MORE-SUSTAINED LONG-RUN INCOME GROWTH.  USING LARGE-SCALE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AND HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA, I ESTIMATE PRECISE SPILLOVER IMPACTS ON EDUCATION THAT REJECT SUBSTANTIVE DECLINES IN CHILDREN'S EDUCATION FROM THE ROLLOUT OF MGNREGA.  THESE NEGATIVE SPILLOVERS ARE INEXPENSIVE TO COUNTERACT, AND SMALL COMPARED TO IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF MGNREGA ON RURAL EMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION.  [TAKEAWAY (ONE-PAGER)] ""RELIGION AND SANITATION PRACTICES""
(WITH M. ALSAN, K. BABIARZ, J. GOLDHABER-FIEBERT, AND L. PRINCE)  (MAY 2021, WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW)
IN INDIA, INFANT MORTALITY AMONG HINDUS IS HIGHER THAN AMONG MUSLIMS, AND RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES IN SANITATION PRACTICES HAVE BEEN CITED AS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. TO EXPLORE WHETHER RELIGION ITSELF IS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN SANITATION PRACTICES, THIS STUDY COMPARES SANITATION PRACTICES OF HINDUS AND MUSLIMS LIVING IN THE SAME LOCATIONS USING THREE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA SETS FROM INDIA. ACROSS ALL THREE DATA SETS, THE UNCONDITIONAL RELIGION-SPECIFIC GAP IN LATRINE OWNERSHIP AND LATRINE USE DECLINES BY APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS WHEN CONDITIONING ON LOCATION CHARACTERISTICS OR INCLUDING LOCATION FIXED EFFECTS. FURTHER, THE ESTIMATES DO NOT SHOW EVIDENCE OF RELIGION-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN OTHER SANITATION PRACTICES, SUCH AS HANDWASHING OR OBSERVED FECAL MATERIAL NEAR HOMES. HOUSEHOLD SANITATION PRACTICES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY ACROSS AREAS OF INDIA, BUT RELIGION ITSELF HAS LESS DIRECT INFLUENCE WHEN CONSIDERING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HINDUS AND MUSLIMS WITHIN THE SAME LOCATION.

(WITH A. CATTANEO, D. BROWN, L. CHRISTIAENSEN, D.K. EVANS, A. HAAKENSTAD, T. MCMENOMY, M. PARTRIDGE, S. VAZ, D. WEISS) (SEPTEMBER 2022, WORLD DEVELOPMENT)
THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONS RELIES ON THEIR POPULATION HAVING PHYSICAL ACCESS TO SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE 3.4 BILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN RURAL LOCATIONS, THIS LARGELY DEPENDS ON THEIR ACCESS TO URBAN CENTERS OF DIFFERENT SIZES. SIMILARLY, URBAN CENTERS DEPEND ON THEIR RURAL HINTERLANDS. BUILDING ON THE LITERATURE ON FUNCTIONAL AREAS/TERRITORIES AND THE RURAL-URBAN CONTINUUM AS WELL AS INSIGHTS FROM CENTRAL PLACE THEORY, THIS REVIEW PAPER ADVANCES THE NOTION OF CATCHMENT AREAS DIFFERENTIATED ALONG AN URBAN-TO-RURAL CONTINUUM TO CAPTURE THESE URBAN-RURAL INTERCONNECTIONS. IT FURTHER SHOWS HOW A NEW, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA SET OPERATIONALIZING THIS CONCEPT CAN SHED NEW LIGHT ON POLICY MAKING ACROSS A SERIES OF DEVELOPMENT FIELDS, INCLUDING INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNANCE, URBANIZATION AND FOOD SYSTEMS, WELFARE AND POVERTY, AND ACCESS TO HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES. TOGETHER THE INSIGHTS SUPPORT A MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY NUANCED PERSPECTIVE ON DEVELOPMENT. [BLOG POST WITH D.K. EVANS: MOST OUT-OF-SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE IN RURAL AREAS.

RAAJ SAH|WEBSITE: RAAJSAH.COM RAAJ SAH IS PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AND ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, HARRIS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY. HE HAS PREVIOUSLY HELD FACULTY POSITIONS IN BUSINESS, ECONOMICS, AND PUBLIC POLICY AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND YALE UNIVERSITY. HE HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL HONORS FOR HIS TEACHING, INCLUDING THREE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. PROFESSOR SAH HAS RECEIVED THE ORDER OF THE RISING SUN, GOLD RAYS WITH NECK RIBBON. THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN CONFERRED THIS HONOR ON BEHALF OF HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN. PROFESSOR SAH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT’S ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE ON TAX REFORMS, PUBLIC REVENUES, DEFICITS, AND REDISTRIBUTION. THESE ARE SOME OF THE CENTRAL ISSUES FOR JAPAN.  PROFESSOR SAH HOLDS A PHD IN ECONOMICS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. HE IS AN MBA FROM THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AHMEDABAD. HIS EARLIER EDUCATION IS FROM BIRLA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE PILANI, AND FROM ST. XAVIER’S COLLEGE RANCHI. BORN IN INDIA, HE IS A US CITIZEN. MANY OF THE WRITINGS OF PROFESSOR SAH CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM RAAJSAH.COM. OTHER WRITINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT ECONPAPERS, IDEAS, SSRN, AND ELSEWHERE ON THE WEB.   THREE OF HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECONOMICS ARE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED BELOW: 1. A HARDWIRED HUMAN CHARACTERISTIC IS FALLIBILITY. THIS FALLIBILITY RESIDES DEEPER THAN WHAT CAN BE REMOVED BY VASTLY LARGER MODELS, BIG AND BIGGER DATA, IMMENSELY GREATER COMPUTATIONAL POWER, ARTIFICIAL AND OTHER LOGIC, ETC. PROFESSOR SAH HAS SHOWN HOW, WITHIN VARIOUS KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS, INDIVIDUALS’ FALLIBILITIES COMBINE TOGETHER TO PRODUCE DIFFERENT OVERALL CONSEQUENCES OF FALLIBILITY. THIS WORK HAS BEEN APPLIED IN MANY CONTEXTS. AMONG THEM ARE FINANCE, SEVERAL BRANCHES OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCES, COMPARISONS OF ALTERNATIVE SOCIETAL SYSTEMS (E.G., POLYARCHIES VERSUS HIERARCHIES), THE ARCHITECTURES OF ORGANIZATIONS AND, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE ISSUE OF DECENTRALIZATION VERSUS CENTRALIZATION. THE DECENTRALIZATION VERSUS CENTRALIZATION OF AUTHORITY AND LEADERSHIP IS AN EVER-PRESENT AND A FOUNDATIONAL ISSUE IN SOCIAL SCIENCES. IT ARISES IN ALL FORMS AND AT  ALL SCALES OF ORGANIZATIONS; FOR EXAMPLE, FROM FAMILIES TO MEGA CORPORATIONS. THIS ISSUE IS ALSO CENTRAL TO POLITICS; ITS VARIATIONS ARE AT LEAST AS OLD AS PLATO, AND AS CONTEMPORARY AS THE UNIFICATION VERSUS AUTONOMY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION. PROFESSOR SAH WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE SPECIFIC AND TESTABLE PREDICTIONS ON THIS TOPIC. ONE SUCH PREDICTION (THE SAH CONJECTURE) IS: A GREATER DECENTRALIZATION OF AUTHORITY REDUCES THE VOLATILITY OF OUTCOMES. OTHER SCHOLARS HAVE CONFIRMED THIS PREDICTION THROUGH THEIR EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATIONS. 2. COMPARABLE SOCIETIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS CAN DISPLAY MARKEDLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CRIME AND CORRUPTION. ANALOGOUSLY, COMPARABLE BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS OFTEN HAVE QUITE DIFFERENT INTERNAL WORK ETHE AND ECOLOGIES. SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE TYPICALLY ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENCES IN CULTURES. THIS IS OFTEN A RESPECTABLE-SOUNDING WAY OF SAYING THAT ONE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND SUCH PHENOMENA. PROFESSOR SAH HAS SHOWN HOW PERCEPTIONS AND REALITIES INFLUENCE EACH OTHER DYNAMICALLY ACROSS TIME. PEOPLES’ CURRENT PERCEPTIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENT AND PAST REALITIES. THESE PERCEPTIONS AFFECT THE INDIVIDUALS’ CURRENT CHOICES AND ACTIONS. SUCH CHOICES, IN TURN, SHAPE FUTURE REALITIES, WHICH THEN INFLUENCE FUTURE PERCEPTIONS. THIS CONCEPTUAL AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK HAS EXPLAINED MANY DIFFICULT-TO-UNDERSTAND PHENOMENA AND PATTERNS. 3. PROFESSOR SAH HAS MADE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUBLIC FINANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, AN IDEA THAT HAS BEEN POPULAR FOR CENTURIES IS THAT INEQUALITIES OF WELL-BEING ACROSS PEOPLE CAN BE REDUCED BY SUBSIDIZING THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE, AND BY PAYING FOR THESE SUBSIDIES BY TAXING THE LUXURIES. VARIATIONS OF THIS IDEA CONTINUE TO HAVE STRONG APPEAL, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE TAXES ON GOODS AND SERVICES ARE A PRIMARY FOUNDATION OF THE GOVERNMENTS’ FINANCES. PROFESSOR SAH WAS THE FIRST TO ASK THE QUESTION: HOW MUCH REDISTRIBUTION IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE THROUGH SUCH POLICIES? THIS IS BECAUSE WITHOUT DETERMINING WHAT IS FEASIBLE, ANY OTHER ANALYSIS WILL NOT BE MEANINGFUL. THE FOLLOWING IS A QUOTATION (FROM TRESCH)  ON ONE OF HIS MANY ORIGINAL RESULTS ON THE TOPIC OUTLINED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH: “RAAJ SAH DEVELOPED A SIMPLE AND INGENIOUS METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE LIMITS OF REDISTRIBUTION UNDER COMMODITY TAXATION THAT RELIES ONLY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S BUDGET CONSTRAINT. HIS METHOD LED HIM TO CONCLUDE THAT COMMODITY TAXES AND SUBSIDIES ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH EQUALIZING EFFECT ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME.”   (PROFESSOR SAH IS PLEASED TO CONVERSE WITH CURRENT AND FORMER STUDENTS, COLLEAGUES, AND OTHERS.
