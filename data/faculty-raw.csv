					WORKING PAPER (NOVEMBER 2012)IMPROVING SECURITY OF TENURE OVER AGRICULTURAL LAND HAS RECENTLY BEEN THE FOCUS OF A NUMBER OF LARGE LAND CERTIFICATION PROGRAMS. WHILE THE MAIN JUSTIFICATION FOR THESE EFFORTS WAS TO INCREASE PRODUCTIVE INVESTMENTS AND FACILITATE LAND RENTAL TRANSACTIONS, WE SHOW THAT IF ACCESS RIGHTS WERE TIED TO ACTUAL LAND USE IN THE PREVIOUS REGIME, THESE PROGRAMS CAN ALSO LEAD TO INCREASED OUTMIGRATION FROM AGRARIAN COMMUNITIES. WE ANALYZE THE MEXICAN EJIDO LAND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WHICH, FROM 1993 TO 2006, AWARDED OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATES TO 3.6 MILLION FARMERS ON ABOUT HALF THE COUNTRY’S AGRICULTURAL LAND. USING THE PROGRAM ROLLOUT OVER TIME AND SPACE AS AN IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY, WE SHOW THAT HOUSEHOLDS OBTAINING LAND CERTIFICATES WERE 30% MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A MIGRANT MEMBER. THE EFFECT WAS LARGER FOR HOUSEHOLDS WITH EX-ANTE WEAKER PROPERTY RIGHTS AND WITH LARGER OFF-FARM OPPORTUNITIES. AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL, CERTIFICATES LED TO A 4% REDUCTION IN POPULATION. WE SHOW EVIDENCE OF CERTIFICATES LEADING TO SORTING, WITH LARGER FARMERS STAYING AND LAND-POOR FARMERS LEAVING IN HIGH PRODUCTIVITY AREAS. WE USE SATELLITE IMAGERY TO DETERMINE THAT, ON AVERAGE, CULTIVATED LAND WAS NOT REDUCED BECAUSE OF THE PROGRAM, CONSISTENT WITH INCREASES IN AGRICULTURAL LABOR PRODUCTIVITY. FURTHERMORE, IN HIGH PRODUCTIVITY AREAS, THE CERTIFICATION PROGRAM LED TO AN INCREASE IN CULTIVATED LAND COMPARED TO LOW PRODUCTIVITY AREAS.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (NOVEMBER 2012)
	WHAT IS THE IMPACT ON VOTING BEHAVIOR OF STRENGTHENING PROPERTY RIGHTS OVER AGRICULTURAL
	LAND? TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION, WE USE THE 14 YEAR NATIONWIDE ROLLOUT OF MEXICO’S LAND
	CERTIFICATION PROGRAM (PROCEDE) AND MATCH AFFECTED COMMUNITIES (EJIDOS) BEFORE AND AFTER
	THE CHANGE IN PROPERTY RIGHTS WITH VOTING OUTCOMES IN CORRESPONDING ELECTORAL SECTIONS
	ACROSS SIX FEDERAL ELECTION CYCLES. WE FIND THAT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTOR CLASS
	THEORY, GRANTING COMPLETE PROPERTY RIGHTS INDUCED A CONSERVATIVE SHIFT TOWARD THE PROMARKET PARTY EQUAL TO 6.8 PERCENT OF ITS AVERAGE SHARE OF VOTES OVER THE PERIOD. THIS SHIFT WAS STRONGEST WHERE VESTED INTERESTS CREATED LARGER EXPECTED BENEFITS FROM MARKETORIENTED POLICIES AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC-TRANSFER POLICIES. WE ALSO FIND THAT BENEFICIARIES FAILED TO RECIPROCATE THROUGH VOTES FOR THE BENEFACTOR PARTY. WE CONCLUDE THAT, IN THE
	MEXICAN EXPERIENCE, ENGAGING IN A LAND REFORM THAT STRENGTHENED INDIVIDUAL PROPERTY
	RIGHTS OVER AGRICULTURAL LAND WAS POLITICALLY ADVANTAGEOUS FOR THE RIGHT-WING PARTY.DOWNLOAD

	USING DATA FROM A RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENT IN RURAL CHINA, THIS PAPER STUDIES THE INFLUENCE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS ON THE DECISION TO ADOPT A NEW WEATHER INSURANCE PRODUCT AND THE MECHANISMS THROUGH WHICH SOCIAL NETWORKS OPERATE. WE PROVIDED FINANCIAL EDUCATION TO A RANDOM SUBSET OF FARMERS AND FOUND A LARGE SOCIAL NETWORK EFFECT ON TAKE-UP: FOR UNTREATED FARMERS, HAVING AN ADDITIONAL FRIEND RECEIVING FINANCIAL EDUCATION RAISED TAKE-UP BY ALMOST HALF AS MUCH AS OBTAINING FINANCIAL EDUCATION DIRECTLY, A SPILLOVER EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO OFFERING A 15% REDUCTION IN THE AVERAGE INSURANCE PREMIUM. BY VARYING THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO INDIVIDUALS ABOUT THEIR PEERS’ TAKE-UP DECISIONS AND USING RANDOMIZED DEFAULT OPTIONS, WE SHOW THAT THE POSITIVE SOCIAL NETWORK EFFECT IS NOT DRIVEN BY THE DIFFUSION OF INFORMATION ON PURCHASE DECISIONS, BUT INSTEAD BY THE DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE ABOUT INSURANCE. WE ALSO FIND THAT SOCIAL NETWORK EFFECTS ARE LARGER IN VILLAGES WHERE HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE STRONGLY CONNECTED, AND WHEN PEOPLE WHO ARE THE FIRST TO RECEIVE FINANCIAL EDUCATION ARE MORE CENTRAL IN THE SOCIAL NETWORK.DOWNLOAD

	A RANDOM SUBSET OF FARMERS AND FOUND A LARGE SOCIAL NETWORK EFFECT ON INSURANCE TAKE-UP: FOR UNTREATED FARMERS, HAVING AN ADDITIONAL FRIEND RECEIVING FINANCIAL EDUCATION RAISES TAKE-UP BY ALMOST HALF AS MUCH AS OBTAINING FINANCIAL EDUCATION DIRECTLY, A SPILLOVER EFFECT EQUIVALENT TO OFFERING A 12% REDUCTION IN THE AVERAGE INSURANCE PREMIUM. BY VARYING THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO SUBJECTS ABOUT THEIR PEERS’ TAKE-UP DECISIONS AND USING RANDOMIZED DEFAULT OPTIONS, I SHOW THAT THE POSITIVE SOCIAL NETWORK EFFECT IS NOT DRIVEN BY SCALE EFFECTS, IMITATION, OR INFORMAL RISK-SHARING, BUT INSTEAD BY THE DIFFUSION OF INSURANCE KNOWLEDGE. ONE YEAR LATER, SOCIAL NETWORKS CONTINUE TO AFFECT INSURANCE DEMAND: OBSERVING AN ABOVE-MEDIAN SHARE OF FRIENDS RECEIVING PAYOUTS INCREASES INSURANCE TAKE-UP AT A RATE EQUIVALENT TO ABOUT 50% OF THE IMPACT OF RECEIVING PAYOUTS DIRECTLY. I ALSO FIND THAT SOCIAL NETWORK EFFECTS ARE LARGER IN VILLAGES WHERE HOUSEHOLDS ARE MORE STRONGLY CONNECTED, AND WHEN THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE FINANCIAL EDUCATION FIRST ARE MORE CENTRAL IN THE SOCIAL NETWORK.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (AUGUST 2011)
	WE ANALYZE THE IMPACT ON VOTING BEHAVIOR OF STRENGTHENING PROPERTY RIGHTS OVER RURAL
	LAND. WE USE THE 14 YEAR NATIONWIDE ROLLOUT OF A LAND CERTIFICATION PROGRAM IN MEXICO
	(PROCEDE) AND MATCH AFFECTED COMMUNITIES (EJIDOS) BEFORE AND AFTER THE CHANGE IN
	PROPERTY RIGHTS WITH VOTING OUTCOMES IN CORRESPONDING ELECTORAL SECTIONS ACROSS SIX
	FEDERAL ELECTION CYCLES. WE FIND THAT, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INVESTOR CLASS THEORY,
	GRANTING COMPLETE PROPERTY RIGHTS INDUCED A CONSERVATIVE SHIFT TOWARD THE PRO-MARKET
	PARTY. THIS SHIFT WAS STRONGEST WHERE VESTED INTERESTS CREATED LARGER EXPECTED BENEFITS
	FROM MARKET-ORIENTED POLICIES AS OPPOSED TO PUBLIC-TRANSFER POLICIES. WE ALSO FIND THAT
	BENEFICIARIES FAILED TO RECIPROCATE THROUGH VOTES TO THE BENEFACTOR PARTY. WE CONCLUDE THAT
	ENGAGING IN A LAND REFORM THAT GRANTS COMPLETE PROPERTY RIGHTS IS ONLY POLITICALLY
	ADVANTAGEOUS FOR A RIGHT-WING PARTY, THUS PROVIDING A RATIONALE AS TO WHY SO MANY LAND
	REFORMS DONE BY AUTOCRATIC GOVERNMENTS REMAIN INCOMPLETE.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (APRIL 2011)
	WE REPORT ON AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH NEW COMMERCIAL SAVINGS PRODUCTS, INFORMED BY THE
	BEHAVIORAL FINANCE LITERATURE, WERE OFFERED TO THE MICROFINANCE BORROWERS OF GUATEMALA’S LARGEST
	PUBLIC-SECTOR BANK. WE FIND THAT GIVING THESE BORROWERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PLAN, AND BE REMINDED
	OF, SAVING AT THE TIME OF LOAN REPAYMENT RESULTED IN A DOUBLING OF SAVINGS DEPOSITS RELATIVE TO THE
	CONTROL, AND THAT PROPOSING A DEFAULT CONTRIBUTION OF 10% OF THE LOAN PAYMENT CAUSED DEPOSITS TO
	DOUBLE AGAIN. THE SAVINGS TREATMENTS ALSO GENERATE FASTER PAY-DOWN OF DEBT AND WEAKLY BETTER
	OVERALL REPAYMENT PERFORMANCE, SUGGESTING THAT SIMULTANEOUS SAVINGS AND BORROWING CAN BE
	COMPLEMENTARY ACTIVITIES. A THEORETICAL MODEL SHOWS THAT THE SIMULTANEOUS PROVISION OF DEBT AND
	COMMITMENT SAVINGS PRODUCTS HELPS A GREATER FRACTION OF THE POPULATION TO EVENTUALLY ESCAPE A
	DEBT-FINANCED EQUILIBRIUM. MAINSTREAMING THE MOST SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT TESTED HERE WOULD ALLOW THE
	BANK TO MOBILIZE SAVINGS SUFFICIENT TO LEVERAGE 50% OF ITS SHORT-TERM LOAN PORTFOLIO.DOWNLOAD

	WE STUDY INSURANCE AGAINST COMMON SHOCKS IN COOPERATIVES AND OTHER PRODUCTIVE
	GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS. IN THOSE GROUPS, AND DUE TO STRATEGIC INTERACTIONS AMONG
	GROUP MEMBERS, INSURANCE DECISIONS MAY BE PREFERABLY TAKEN AT THE GROUP LEVEL
	RATHER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL. WE HIGHLIGHT TWO KINDS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS WITH
	INDIVIDUAL INSURANCE : THE FIRST ONE IS A FREE-RIDING PROBLEM BECAUSE DUE TO STRATEGIC
	INTERACTIONS, INSURANCE DECISIONS EXERT A POSITIVE EXTERNALITY ON OTHER GROUP MEMBERS
	; THE SECOND ONE IS A COORDINATION PROBLEM THAT OCCURS BECAUSE IT MAY BE UNPROTABLE
	FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO TAKE INSURANCE IF THE OTHERS IN THE GROUP DO NOT. BOTH TYPES OF
	PROBLEMS CAN BE RESOLVED IF INSURANCE IS OERED AT THE GROUP LEVEL.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (JULY 2010)
	THE FAIR TRADE (FT) INITIATIVE HAS BEEN HUGELY POPULAR WITH COFFEE CONSUMERS AROUND THE WORLD, AND
	YET THE CREATION OF DURABLE PRODUCER RENTS IS CHALLENGING IN A COMPETITIVE MARKET ENVIRONMENT. WE
	MODEL THE FT PREMIUM ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY PRODUCERS AND SUGGEST THAT RENTS ARE IN FACT DISSIPATED,
	BUT THAT THIS OCCURS IN WAYS THAT ARE QUITE OBSCURE TO CONSUMERS. FIRST, OVER-CERTIFICATION DILUTES THE
	EFFECTIVE PREMIUM EVEN DURING YEARS IN WHICH THE NOMINAL FT PREMIUM IS HIGH. THEN, THE USE OF A
	QUALITY-INVARIANT FT FLOOR PRICE IN THE VERY HETEROGENEOUS MARKET FOR COFFEE CREATES A SECOND,
	COMPLETELY UNRELATED MECHANISM THROUGH WHICH PRODUCER BENEFIT IS ERODED. WE USE UNIQUE DATA
	FROM A LARGE ASSOCIATION OF COFFEE COOPERATIVES IN CENTRAL AMERICA TO MEASURE NOMINAL FT
	PREMIUMS RECEIVED BY MEMBER COOPERATIVES, COMPARING COFFEE OF THE EXACT SAME QUALITY SOLD WITH
	AND WITHOUT THE FT LABEL. WE CONFIRM THAT NOMINAL PREMIUMS ARE DISSIPATED BY OVER-CERTIFICATION
	AND UNREWARDED QUALITY DIFFERENTIALS. IN EFFECT, FT MEMBERSHIP IS PRICED LIKE A PUT OPTION: PRODUCERS
	ARE WILLING TO LOSE A SMALL AMOUNT THROUGH PARTICIPATION DURING YEARS IN WHICH THE MARKET PRICE IS
	HIGH IN ORDER TO RETAIN FUTURE ACCESS TO THE FT FLOOR PRICE. WE CONCLUDE BY DISCUSSING WAYS IN WHICH
	THE FT MECHANISM COULD BE ADJUSTED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ETHICAL CONSUMERS’ WILLINGNESS TO PAY IN
	ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED TRANSFERS OF RENTS TO SMALLHOLDER PRODUCERS.DOWNLOAD

	EVEN THOUGH SEVERAL STUDIES HAVE ASSESSED THE DEGREE OF PROGRESSIVITY IN TARGETING
	COMMUNITIES UNDER THE PARTICIPATORY SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND (SIF) APPROACH TO
	THE PROVISION OF LOCAL PUBLIC GOODS, THERE IS YET LITTLE EVIDENCE ON HOW INCREASING
	DECENTRALIZATION AFFECTS THE QUALITY OF THIS TARGETING. WE IDENTIFY THE IMPACT OF
	INCREASING DECENTRALIZATION ON COMMUNITY TARGETING USING THE UNIQUE SITUATION OF
	ZAMBIA’S SIFS WHERE THE DEGREE OF DECENTRALIZATION CHANGED IN TIME AND SPACE
	ACROSS DISTRICTS OVER THE 15 YEARS OF PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. WE FIND THAT GREATER
	DECENTRALIZATION OF SIFS’ FUNCTIONS TO DISTRICTS THAT HAD BEEN DEEMED TO HAVE THE
	NECESSARY LEVEL OF MANAGERIAL CAPACITY LED TO MORE PROGRESSIVE TARGETING ACROSS
	WARDS, MILDLY SO AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND STRONGLY SO WITHIN DISTRICTS. WE ALSO
	OBSERVE HOW LOCAL ELECTORAL POLITICS GAINED IMPORTANCE WITH GREATER
	DECENTRALIZATION, WITH MORE VOTES RECEIVED BY THE CANDIDATE FROM THE MAJORITY
	PARTY IN THE DISTRICT COUNCIL ATTRACTING MORE PROJECTS TO A WARD, AND MORE PROJECTS
	IN A WARD REWARDED BY MORE VOTES FOR THE COUNCILOR FROM THE INCUMBENT PARTY.

					WORKING PAPER (MARCH 2009)
	FOOD PRICES HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED BETWEEN MID-2006 AND MID-2008, CREATING MAJOR
	DISTRESS AMONG THE POOR ACROSS THE WORLD, BUT ALSO GAINERS AMONG FARM PRODUCERS. WHILE
	TRANSMISSION WAS LARGELY AVERTED IN INDIA, INCREASINGLY OPEN FOOD MARKETS INDICATE THE
	NEED TO ANTICIPATE THE WELFARE IMPLICATIONS OF A REPETITION OF SUCH EVENTS IN THE FUTURE.
	THIS PAPER SIMULATES THE WELFARE EFFECTS OF THE RISE IN THE INTERNATIONAL PRICE OF CEREALS
	AND EDIBLE OILS ON A COMPREHENSIVE TYPOLOGY OF INDIAN HOUSEHOLDS. RESULTS SHOW THAT
	LARGE FARMERS(WITH FARM SIZE OF ONE HECTARE AND MORE) WOULD HAVE GAINED AS A GROUP, AND
	THAT THE AVERAGE GAIN IS LARGE FOR THOSE WHO GAIN, BUT THAT 59% OF THEM IN FACT LOSE. THE
	MAIN CATEGORY OF POOR HOUSEHOLDS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE RISE IN PRICES IS RURAL
	(REPRESENTING 77% OF ALL LOSING POOR HOUSEHOLDS), BOTH FARMERS AND NON-FARMERS. THIS IS
	CONTRARY TO CONVENTIONAL WISDOM THAT LOOKS AT THE URBAN POOR AS THE MAIN CATEGORY TO BE
	SHELTERED FROM RISING PRICES THROUGH SAFETY NET MEASURES, AND EXPECTS MOST FARMERS TO
	GAIN. THESE RURAL HOUSEHOLDS ACCOUNT FOR 79% OF THE AGGREGATE WELFARE LOSS AMONG THE
	POOR. THIS MAKES A FORCEFUL CASE FOR THE NEED TO LOOK BEYOND THE URBAN POOR WHEN FOOD

	CHINA’S RECORD IN REDUCING RURAL POVERTY HAS BEEN NOTHING SHORT OF SPECTACULAR AND SHOULD BE A SOURCE OF
	LESSONS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES. RURAL POVERTY REDUCTION IS GENERALLY SOUGHT IN THE ROLE OF AGRICULTURE IN
	CONTRIBUTING TO FARM INCOMES. HOWEVER, NON-FARM EMPLOYMENT IN RURAL AREAS CAN ALSO BE A MAJOR
	CONTRIBUTOR. USING DETAILED HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA FROM HUBEI PROVINCE, WE SIMULATE THE COUNTERFACTUAL OF
	WHAT RURAL HOUSEHOLDS’ INCOMES, POVERTY, AND INEQUALITY WOULD BE IN THE ABSENCE OF ACCESS TO NON-FARM
	SOURCES OF INCOME. RESULTS SHOW THAT, WITHOUT NON-FARM EMPLOYMENT, RURAL POVERTY WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER
	AND DEEPER, AND THAT INCOME INEQUALITY WOULD BE HIGHER AS WELL. WE FIND THAT EDUCATION, PROXIMITY TO
	TOWN, NEIGHBORHOOD EFFECTS, AND VILLAGE EFFECTS ARE CRUCIAL IN HELPING PARTICULAR HOUSEHOLDS GAIN ACCESS TO
	THESE OPPORTUNITIES. WE ALSO FIND THAT THOSE WHO STAY AS PURE FARMERS HAVE NON-OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS
	THAT MAKE THEM MUCH MORE PRODUCTIVE IN AGRICULTURE, IMPLYING POSITIVE SELECTION ON THESE CHARACTERISTICS.
	MOREOVER, PARTICIPATION IN NON-FARM ACTIVITIES HAS A POSITIVE SPILLOVER EFFECT ON HOUSEHOLD FARM

	THE PERSISTENCE OF RURAL POVERTY, CONCENTRATION IN RURAL AREAS OF THE MOST EXTREME FORMS OF
	POVERTY, AND RISING INEQUALITY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF RURAL INCOMES REMAIN VEXING ASPECTS OF RURAL
	DEVELOPMENT IN LATIN AMERICA, IN SPITE OF EXPENSIVE PROGRAMS INTENDED AT REDUCING POVERTY AND INEQUALITY.
	MEXICO IS NO EXCEPTION TO THIS OBSERVATION. THIS WIDESPREAD FAILURE CALLS UPON EXPLORING ALTERNATIVE
	APPROACHES TO RURAL DEVELOPMENT THAT MAY HAVE GREATER CHANCES OF SUCCESS. TAKING AN APPROACH THAT
	DISTINGUISHES BETWEEN MARGINAL AND FAVORABLE AREAS, AND THAT SEEKS TO INTEGRATE RURAL AND URBAN ACTIVITIES IN
	A TERRITORIAL DIMENSION CENTERED AROUND REGIONAL ECONOMIC PROJECTS AND THE ECONOMIC INCORPORATION OF THE
	POOR IS ONE SUCH OPTION THAT DESERVES FURTHER CONSIDERATION. IT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN MEXICO THROUGH THE
	MICROREGIONS STRATEGY. WHILE IT IS TOO EARLY TO EVALUATE THIS PROGRAM, WE DERIVE LESSONS FROM INTERNATIONAL
	EXPERIENCES THAT PROVIDE GUIDELINES TO ASSESS THE MEXICAN STRATEGY.
	WE DO THIS BY FIRST CHARACTERIZING THE RECENT EVOLUTION OF RURAL POVERTY AND INEQUALITY IN LATIN
	AMERICA. WE THEN PROCEED TO EXPLORE A SET OF QUALITATIVE CHANGES IN RURAL POVERTY THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN INTO
	ACCOUNT IN A NEW APPROACH. THIS IS COMPLEMENTED BY ANALYZING A SET OF NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR RURAL POVERTY
	REDUCTION THAT SHOULD ALSO BE FACTORED INTO A NEW APPROACH. ON THE BASIS OF INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCES WITH

	FARMERS INCUR PROPORTIONAL AND FIXED TRANSACTIONS COSTS IN SELLING THEIR CROPS ON MARKETS.
	USING DATA FOR PERUVIAN POTATO FARMERS, WE PROPOSE A METHOD TO MEASURE THESE TRANSACTIONS COSTS.
	WHEN OPPORTUNITIES EXIST TO SELL A CROP ON ALTERNATIVE MARKETS, THE OBSERVED CHOICE OF MARKET CAN BE
	USED TO INFER A MONETARY MEASURE OF TRANSACTIONS COSTS IN MARKET PARTICIPATION. THE MARKET CHOICE
	MODEL IS FIRST ESTIMATED AT THE REDUCED FORM LEVEL WITH A CONDITIONAL LOGIT, AS A FUNCTION OF VARIABLES
	THAT EXPLAIN TRANSACTIONS COSTS. WE THEN USE THESE MARKET CHOICE EQUATIONS TO CONTROL FOR SELECTION IN
	PREDICTING THE IDIOSYNCRATIC PRICES THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED ON ALL MARKETS AND THE IDIOSYNCRATIC
	PROPORTIONAL TRANSACTIONS COSTS THAT WOULD BE INCURRED TO REACH ALL MARKETS. THE NET BETWEEN THE TWO
	GIVES US A MEASURE OF EFFECTIVE FARM-LEVEL PRICES. THIS ALLOWS US TO ESTIMATE A SEMI-STRUCTURAL
	CONDITIONAL LOGIT OF THE MARKET CHOICE MODEL. IN THIS MODEL, THE CHOICE OF MARKET IS A FUNCTION OF
	PREDICTED EFFECTIVE FARM-LEVEL PRICES, AND OF MARKET INFORMATION THAT ACCOUNTS FOR FIXED TRANSACTIONS
	COSTS. WE CAN USE THE ESTIMATED COEFFICIENTS TO DERIVE THE PRICE EQUIVALENCE OF THE FIXED COST DUE TO
	INFORMATION. WE FIND THAT THE INFORMATION ON MARKET PRICE THAT FARMERS RECEIVE FROM THEIR NEIGHBORS
	REDUCES FIXED TRANSACTIONS COSTS BY THE EQUIVALENT OF DOUBLING THE PRICE RECEIVED, AND IS EQUAL TO FOUR
	TIMES THE AVERAGE TRANSPORTATION COST.DOWNLOAD

	THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT INSECURITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS OVER AGRICULTURAL LAND CAN HAVE LARGE EFFICIENCY AND EQUITY COSTS BECAUSE OF THE WAY IT AFFECTS MATCHING IN THE TENANCY MARKET. A PRINCIPAL-AGENT FRAMEWORK IS USED TO MODEL THE LANDLORD’S DECISION TO RENT WHEN HE TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE RISK OF LOSING THE LAND TO THE TENANT AND WHEN CONTRACT ENFORCEMENT IS DECREASING IN SOCIAL DISTANCE WITH THE TENANT. THESE EFFECTS ARE QUANTIFIED FOR THE CASE OF LOCAL LAND RENTAL MARKETS IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC. RESULTS SHOW THAT INSECURE PROPERTY RIGHTS LEAD TO MATCHING IN THE TENANCY MARKET ALONG SOCIO-ECONOMIC LINES, SEVERELY LIMITING THE SIZE OF THE RENTAL MARKET AND THE CHOICE OF TENANTS FOR LANDLORDS, BOTH WITH EFFICIENCY COSTS. SOCIAL SEGMENTATION REDUCES ACCESS TO LAND FOR THE RURAL POOR, WITH HIGH EQUITY COSTS. SIMULATIONS SUGGEST THAT IMPROVING TENURE SECURITY WOULD INCREASE RENTAL TRANSACTIONS BY 21% AND THE AREA RENTED TO THE POOR BY 63%. INCREASED PROPERTY RIGHTS SECURITY IS HENCE BENEFICIAL NOT ONLY TO ASSET OWNERS, BUT ALSO TO THOSE WITH WHOM THEY MIGHT INTERACT IN THE MARKET.DOWNLOAD

	EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE HAS SHOWN THAT OFF-FARM NON-AGRICULTURAL (OFNA) EMPLOYMENT OFFERS A MAJOR PATHWAY FROM POVERTY FOR RURAL POPULATIONS. HOWEVER, THE PATTERN OF PARTICIPATION IN THESE ACTIVITIES IS HETEROGENEOUS ACROSS CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS AND POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE EXPLORE THE ROLE OF SPILLOVERS FROM PEERS ON AN INDIVIDUAL’S PARTICIPATION IN FORMAL AND INFORMAL OFNA EMPLOYMENT USING VILLAGE CENSUS DATA FOR RURAL MEXICO. WE TEST AND REJECT THE POSSIBILITY THAT PEERS’ DECISIONS COULD BE PROXYING FOR UNOBSERVED INDIVIDUAL, VILLAGE-LEVEL, OR INDIVIDUAL-TYPE EFFECTS. WE FIND THAT PEERS’ PARTICIPATION IN OFNA EMPLOYMENT HAS A LARGE IMPACT ON AN INDIVIDUAL’S ABILITY TO ENGAGE IN THIS TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT, BOTH FORMAL AND INFORMAL, EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR
	INDIVIDUAL ATTRIBUTES AND VILLAGE CHARACTERISTICS. PEER EFFECTS ARE STRUCTURED BY SIMILARITIES IN GENDER, ETHNICITY, EDUCATIONAL LEVEL, AND LAND ENDOWMENT. WE FIND THAT MARGINAL PEER EFFECTS TEND TO BE STRONGER FOR CATEGORIES OF INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE ALREADY MORE ENGAGED IN OFNA EMPLOYMENT, SUCH AS MEN, NON-INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, THE MORE EDUCATED, AND THE LANDLESS, CONTRIBUTING TO REINFORCING INEQUALITIES IN ACCESSING THESE JOBS. HOWEVER, THE ROLE OF PEER EFFECTS RELATIVE TO THAT OF EDUCATION IN OBTAINING FORMAL OFNA EMPLOYMENT IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR MEMBERS OF GROUPS THAT ARE LESS ENGAGED IN THESE JOBS, SUCH AS WOMEN, INDIGENOUS PEOPLE, THE LESS EDUCATED, AND SMALLHOLDERS.DOWNLOAD

THIS PAPER ATTEMPTS TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION, IDENTIFYING CAUSES THAT HAVE LED TO THE CRISIS, OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW DEPARTURES, AND FORCES THAT COULD BE MOBILIZED IN ORDER TO AVOID THE BUSINESS-AS-USUAL SCENARIO AND PROMOTE INSTEAD THE AGRICULTURE-FOR-DEVELOPMENT OUTCOME.DOWNLOAD

	FOOD PRICES ROSE SHARPLY ON THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET BETWEEN JANUARY 2005 AND MID-2008, PRECIPITATING WHAT HAS BECOME KNOWN ASTHE “GLOBAL FOOD CRISIS”. YET, HOW MUCH OF A CRISIS WAS IT AT THE HOUSEHOLD LEVEL, AND FOR WHOM WAS IT A CRISIS? THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE WELFARE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN PRICES OVER CATEGORIES OF HOUSEHOLDS IN GUATEMALA. WE FIND THREE SURPRISING RESULTS. THE FIRST IS THAT THERE WAS NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT TRANSMISSION OF INTERNATIONAL INTO DOMESTIC PRICES OVER THE THREE AND A HALF YEARS THAT THE CRISIS LASTED. MOST REAL STAPLE FOOD PRICES ROSE, BUT CHANGES WERE MODEST AND CERTAINLY FAR REMOVED FROM FULL TRANSMISSION AS FREQUENTLY ASSUMED. WELFARE EFFECTS WERE AS A CONSEQUENCE SMALL. THE SECOND SURPRISING RESULT
	IS THAT, GIVEN HIGH FOOD DEPENDENCY FOR FARMER HOUSEHOLDS, INCLUDING LARGE FARMERS, MOST OF THESE HOUSEHOLDS LOST FROM THE RISE IN PRICES, ESPECIALLY OF COURSE THE MARGINAL, SMALL, AND MEDIUM FARMERS. ONLY IF INTERNATIONAL PRICES HAD FULLY TRANSMITTED WOULD HALF OF THE LARGE FARMERS HAVE GAINED, WITH THE VAST MAJORITY IN THE OTHER CATEGORIES STILL LOSING. ALLOWING FOR PRICE RESPONSES IN BOTH PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION MITIGATES NEGATIVE EFFECTS, BUT STILL LEAVES A VAST MAJORITY OF THE FARMER POPULATION LOSING. FINALLY, THE THIRD SURPRISING RESULT IS THAT FARMER HOUSEHOLDS REPRESENT AS MANY ASTWO-THIRDS OF ALL POOR HOUSEHOLDSLOSING FROM RISING FOOD PRICES. INCREASING THE PRODUCTIVITY OF PRODUCTION FOR HOME CONSUMPTION IN SMALLHOLDER FARMING CAN THUS BE AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT IN COMBATING THE SHORT RUN WELFARE LOSSES OF RISING FOOD PRICES AMONG POOR HOUSEHOLDS.DOWNLOAD

DE JANVRY ALAIN AND ELISABETH SADOULET. 2010. ""AGRICULTURAL GROWTH AND POVERTY REDUCTION: ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE"". WORLD BANK RESEARCH OBSERVER 25: 1-20.
	AGRICULTURAL GROWTH HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT FOR POVERTY REDUCTION. YET, MEASUREMENTS OF THIS RELATIONSHIP ARE STILL SCARCE AND NOT ALWAYS RELIABLE. THIS PAPER PRESENTS ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE AT BOTH THE SECTORAL AND HOUSEHOLD LEVELS BASED ON RECENT DATA. RESULTS SHOW THAT RURAL POVERTY REDUCTION HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH GROWTH IN YIELDS AND IN AGRICULTURAL LABOR PRODUCTIVITY, BUT THAT THIS RELATION VARIES SHARPLY ACROSS REGIONAL CONTEXTS. GDP GROWTH ORIGINATING IN AGRICULTURE INDUCES INCOME GROWTH AMONG THE 40% POOREST WHICH IS ON THE ORDER OF THREE TIMES LARGER THAN GROWTH ORIGINATING IN THE REST OF THE ECONOMY. THE POWER OF AGRICULTURE COMES NOT ONLY FROM ITS DIRECT POVERTY REDUCTION EFFECT BUT ALSO FROM ITS POTENTIALLY STRONG GROWTH LINKAGE EFFECTS ON THE REST OF THE ECONOMY. DECOMPOSING THE AGGREGATE DECLINE IN POVERTY INTO A RURAL CONTRIBUTION, AN URBAN CONTRIBUTION, AND A POPULATION SHIFT COMPONENT SHOWS THAT RURAL AREAS CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN HALF THE OBSERVED AGGREGATE DECLINE IN POVERTY. FINALLY, USING THE EXAMPLE OF VIETNAM, WE SHOW THAT RAPID GROWTH IN AGRICULTURE HAS OPENED PATHWAYS OUT OF POVERTY FOR FARMING HOUSEHOLDS. WHILE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF AGRICULTURAL GROWTH IN REDUCING POVERTY IS WELL ESTABLISHED, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN INDUCING AGRICULTURAL GROWTH IS STILL INCOMPLETE AND CONDITIONAL ON CONTEXT.DOWNLOAD

	ONE MAJOR CONCERN WITH PUBLIC SCHOOL OPEN ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS IS THE POTENTIAL FOR PARENTS’ SCHOOL SELECTION ERRORS TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THEIR CHILDREN’S ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. IN THISSTUDY OF THE BEIJING MIDDLE SCHOOL OPEN ENROLLMENT PROGRAM, WE ESTIMATE THE DEGREE TO WHICH CHILDREN’S SCHOOL OUTCOMES WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE POOR CHOICES THEIR PARENTS MADE DURING THE SCHOOL SELECTION PROCESS. WE DO THIS BY EXAMINING PARENTS’ RESPONSES TO A SURVEY ON SCHOOL CHOICES COMBINED WITH ACTUAL SCHOOL APPLICATIONS, SCHOOL ADMISSION RECORDS, AND HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAMINATION TEST SCORES FOR 4,717 STUDENTS ENTERING MIDDLE SCHOOLS IN BEIJING VIA RANDOMIZED LOTTERIES. WE FIND THAT THE CHILDREN OF PARENTS WHO MADE JUDGMENT ERRORS IN SCHOOL SELECTION WERE ADMITTED TO LOWER QUALITY SCHOOLS AND ACHIEVED LOWER TESTSCORES ON THE HIGH SCHOOL ENTRANCE EXAMINATION. PARENTS WHO HAD LESS EDUCATION, WHOSE CHILDREN PERFORMED AT LOWER LEVELS IN PRIMARY SCHOOL, AND WHO WERE LESS ATTENTIVE TO TEACHERS’ OPINIONS ABOUT SCHOOLS WERE MORE PRONE TO MAKE THESE ERRORS. PROVIDING ASSISTANCE TO PARENTS, ESPECIALLY THOSE LESS PREPARED TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT SCHOOL SELECTION, IS CONSEQUENTLY IMPORTANT FOR SUPPORTING MORE EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE OPEN ENROLLMENT PROGRAMS.DOWNLOAD

	CREDIT AGENTS IN MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS (MFIS) MUST BE GIVEN INCENTIVES TO ACQUIRE INFORMATION ON POTENTIAL BORROWERS AND SELECT THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MFI'S OBJECTIVES. WE SHOW THAT WHILE GIVING INCENTIVES HAS NO COST IN FOR-PROFIT MFIS, IT IS COSTLY IN PRO-POOR MFIS: WHEN REPAYMENT AND WEALTH ARE POSITIVELY CORRELATED, A PRO-POOR MFI CANNOT OBTAIN THE SELECTION OF POOR CLIENTS IN THE PROPORTION IT WISHES WITH INCENTIVES BASED SOLELY ON REPAYMENT. IT THEN BECOMES NECESSARY TO AUDIT THE SHARE OF VERY POOR BORROWERS SELECTED BY AN AGENT IN ORDER TO PROVIDE THE LATTER WITH ADEQUATE INCENTIVES. WHEN AUDIT COSTS ARE LARGE, PRO-POOR MFIS MAY HAVE TO FOREGO SELECTION ON WEALTH -- AND USE OTHER TARGETING DEVICES SUCH AS WORKING IN IMPOVERISHED GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATIONS. DRIVEN BY DONOR CONCERNS WITH 'MISSION DRIFT' AWAY FROM THE POOR, AUDITS ON THE WEALTH STATUS OF CLIENTS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED AT THE LEVEL OF MFIS. WE SHOW THAT INTRODUCING PRO-POOR INCENTIVES REQUIRES EXTENDING SUCH AUDITS TO THE LEVEL OF CREDIT AGENTS.DOWNLOAD

	THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE THAT AGRICULTURE PLAYS IN DEVELOPMENT HAS LONG BEEN RECOGNIZED. IN THE SEMINAL WORK ON THE SUBJECT, AGRICULTURE WAS SEEN AS A SOURCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS THAT HELPED INDUCE INDUSTRIAL GROWTH AND A STRUCTURAL TRANSFORMATION OF THE ECONOMY. HOWEVER, GLOBALIZATION, INTEGRATED VALUE CHAINS, RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL AND INSTITUTIONAL INNOVATIONS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS HAVE RAPIDLY CHANGED THE CONTEXT FOR AGRICULTURE’S ROLE. WE ARGUE THAT A NEW
	PARADIGM IS NEEDED THAT RECOGNIZES AGRICULTURE’S MULTIPLE FUNCTIONS FOR DEVELOPMENT IN THAT EMERGING CONTEXT: TRIGGERING ECONOMIC GROWTH, REDUCING POVERTY, NARROWING INCOME DISPARITIES, PROVIDING FOOD SECURITY, AND DELIVERING ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES. YET, GOVERNMENTS AND DONORS HAVE NEGLECTED THESE FUNCTIONS OF AGRICULTURE WITH THE RESULT THAT AGRICULTURE GROWTH HAS BEEN REDUCED, 75% OF WORLD POVERTY IS RURAL, SECTORAL DISPARITIES HAVE EXPLODED, FOOD INSECURITY HAS RETURNED, AND ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION IS WIDESPREAD. MOBILIZING THESE FUNCTIONS REQUIRES SHIFTING THE POLITICAL ECONOMY TO OVERCOME ANTI-AGRICULTURE POLICY BIASES, STRENGTHENING GOVERNANCE FOR AGRICULTURE, AND TAILORING PRIORITIES TO COUNTRY CONDITIONS.DOWNLOAD

	WHILE AGRICULTURE IS RARELY A SENSATIONAL TOPIC, IT HAS BEEN IN THE HEADLINES ACROSS THE WORLD OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, IF FOR THE WRONG REASONS. “THE END OF CHEAP FOOD”, “THE SILENT TSUNAMI”, “GRAINS GONE WILD”, “ACROSS THE GLOBE, EMPTY BELLIES BRING RISING ANGER” HAVE BEEN FRONT PAGE TITLES IN THE ECONOMIST AND THE NEW YORK TIMES. THIS SURGE OF INTEREST IN AGRICULTURE AND WHAT IT CAN DO FOR DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN MOTIVATED BY A CONJUNCTION OF NEGATIVE OUTCOMES: SHARPLY RISING FOOD PRICES WITH
	ASSOCIATED FOOD RIOTS AND RISING HUNGER; AN APPROACHING DEADLINE FOR THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDG) THAT WILL NOT BE UNMET IN MOST COUNTRIES, WHILE 75% OF WORLD POVERTY IS RURAL AND AGRICULTURE HAS TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IF THE MDG OF HALVING POVERTY IS TO BE MET; RISING RURAL-URBAN INCOME DISPARITIES CREATING POLITICAL TENSIONS IN RAPIDLY GROWING COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA AND INDIA; THREATS TO THE FUTURE OF THE FAMILY FARM AND EXCESSIVELY RAPID RURAL EXODUS TOWARD URBAN SLUMS; NEW DEMANDS ON AGRICULTURE TO CONTRIBUTE TO ENERGY SUPPLY AND TO DELIVER ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES; THE DESTABILIZATION OF WEATHER PATTERNS AND RISING TEMPERATURES CREATING THREATS TO THE RESILIENCE OF FARMING SYSTEMS ON WHICH THE RURAL POOR DEPEND; RISING WATER SCARCITY AND POLLUTION OF POTABLE WATER SOURCES WITH AGRO-CHEMICALS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INTENSIFICATION OF CROPPING PATTERNS; LOSS OF BIODIVERSITY ASSOCIATED WITH DEFORESTATION AND HORIZONTAL EXPANSION OF EXTENSIVE FARMING SYSTEMS; AND PANDEMICS SUCH AS THE AVIAN FLU LINKING AGRICULTURE TO HUMAN HEALTH. AGRICULTURE CLEARLY NEEDS TO DO A BETTER JOB FOR DEVELOPMENT AS THE DEVELOPMENTAL FAILURES OF AGRICULTURE HAVE REACHED CRISIS PROPORTION. REASSESSING WHY AGRICULTURE HAS NOT BEEN MORE EFFECTIVELY USED FOR DEVELOPMENT IS THUS HAPPENING BY POPULAR DEMAND.
	YET, CAN WE EXPECT THAT THIS REASSESSMENT WILL RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ON THE WAY AGRICULTURE IS USED FOR DEVELOPMENT? OR ARE WE TO RETURN TO “BUSINESS AS USUAL”, WITH A CONTINUED NEGLECT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE ASSOCIATED FAILED OPPORTUNITIES TO USE IT TO
	STIMULATE GROWTH IN POOR COUNTRIES, REDUCE RURAL POVERTY, AND IMPROVE SUSTAINABILITY IN RESOURCE USE, AS OCCURRED OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS FOLLOWING THE DEBT CRISIS AND THE POLICIES OF THE WASHINGTON CONSENSUS. THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT REPORT 2008 WAS A CALL TO MAKE BETTER USE OF AGRICULTURE FOR DEVELOPMENT. URGENCY OF THE CALL HAS BEEN ENHANCED BY THE FOOD CRISIS. WILL GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HEAR THE CALL AND STOP TURNING THEIR BACKS ON AGRICULTURE? WHAT WOULD IT TAKE FOR AGRICULTURE TO BE EFFECTIVELY USED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND TO ADDRESS THE MANY CRISIS THAT HAVE BROUGHT IT TO 2 THE HEADLINES? IT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PRESENTATION TO RAISE THESE QUESTIONS AND DISCUSS ANSWERS.DOWNLOAD

	FORMAL VILLAGE ORGANIZATIONS (VO) CAN BE CLASSIFIED INTO MARKET-ORIENTED (MO) AND COMMUNITYORIENTED (CO) ORGANIZATIONS, WITH THE FORMER AIMED AT RAISING MEMBERS’ INCOMES AND THE LATTER AT THE PROVISION OF LOCAL PUBLIC GOODS. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE ROLE OF COMMUNITY CONSERVATISM IN OPPOSING ECONOMIC DIFFERENTIATION AND, THEREBY, CONSTRAINING THE EMERGENCE, CONFIGURATION, AND ACTIVITIES OF MOS IN WEST AFRICA. TO DO THIS, WE DEVELOP A MODEL WHERE WE SHOW THAT, IF THESE CONSERVATIVE FORCES ARE IMPORTANT, MOS NEED TO BE LARGER THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE OPTIMAL IN ORDER TO GAIN ACCEPTABILITY AND EMERGE. THIS, IN TURN, HAS AN IMPACT ON THEIR GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE, AS THE NEEDED EXTRA MEMBERS DEMAND A MORE PARTICIPATORY DECISION-MAKING PROCESS IN ORDER TO SECURE THE DELIVERY OF CLUB GOODS, CONSTRAINING THE EXERCISE OF LEADERSHIP. WITH VERY HIGH RESISTANCE TO ECONOMIC DIFFERENTIATION, NO MO CAN EMERGE. USING A DATASET OF 646 VOS IN BURKINA FASO, WE IDENTIFY A SHARP CONTRAST IN INITIAL SIZE AND GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE BETWEEN THE FIRST MO TO EMERGE IN A VILLAGE AND SUBSEQUENT MOS. THIS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL ASSUMING THAT FIRST MOS ENCOUNTER STRONG OPPOSITION TO THEIR EMERGENCE, WHILE THE SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT IS MORE TOLERANT FORSUBSEQUENT MOS..DOWNLOAD

	ACCESS TO LAND, AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT HAPPENS, PLAY A FUNDAMENTAL ROLE IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THIS IS BECAUSE HOW THE MODES OF ACCESS TO LAND AND THE RULES AND CONDITIONS OF ACCESS ARE SET, AS POLICY INSTRUMENTS, HAS THE POTENTIAL OF INCREASING AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT AND AGGREGATE INCOME GROWTH, HELPING REDUCE POVERTY AND INEQUALITY, IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, AND PROVIDING THE BASIS FOR EFFECTIVE GOVERNANCE AND SECURING PEACE. THIS POTENTIAL ROLE IS, HOWEVER, DIFFICULT TO CAPTURE, AND THERE ARE MANY CASES OF FAILURE. HISTORY IS INDEED REPLETE WITH SERIOUS CONFLICTS OVER ACCESS TO LAND AND WITH INSTANCES OF WASTEFUL USES OF THE LAND, BOTH PRIVATELY AND SOCIALLY. GOVERNMENTS AND DEVELOPMENT AGENCIES HAVE FOR THIS REASON HAD TO DEAL WITH THE “LAND QUESTION” AS AN IMPORTANT ITEM ON THEIR AGENDAS (DE JANVRY ET AL., 2002). WE EXPLAIN IN THIS NOTE: (1) WHY ACCESS TO LAND, AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT IS ACCESSED AND USED, ARE IMPORTANT FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, (2) HOW DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROPERTY RIGHTS CAN AFFECT ACCESS AND USE, (3) WHAT ARE DIFFERENT MODES OF ACCESS, AND IN PARTICULAR THE ROLE OF LAND MARKETS, AND (4) WHAT ARE SOME OF THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS TO ENHANCE HOW ACCESS TO AND USE OF THE LAND CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. WE STRESS IN THIS NOTE THAT ACCESS TO LAND MAY BE A DIFFICULT POLICY QUESTION, BUT THAT ACCESS WILL ONLY TRANSLATE INTO DEVELOPMENT IF THE HARDER QUESTION OF INFLUENCING HOW IT IS USED IS EFFECTIVELY RESOLVED.DOWNLOAD

	THIS PAPER DISCUSSES THE GAIN IN EFFICIENCY FROM INCLUDING DEFORESTATION RISK AS A TARGETING CRITERION IN PAYMENTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICES (PES) PROGRAMS. WE CONTRAST TWO PAYMENT SCHEMES THAT WE SIMULATE USING DATA FROM MEXICAN COMMON PROPERTY FORESTS: A FLAT PAYMENT SCHEME WITH A CAP ON ALLOWABLE HECTARES PER ENROLLEE, SIMILAR TO THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTED IN MANY COUNTRIES, AND A  PAYMENT THAT TAKES DEFORESTATION RISK AND HETEROGENEITY IN LAND PRODUCTIVITY INTO ACCOUNT. WE SIMULATE THE LATTER STRATEGY BOTH WITH AND WITHOUT A BUDGET CONSTRAINT. USING OBSERVED PAST DEFORESTATION, WE FIND THAT WHILE RISK-TARGETED PAYMENTS ARE FAR MORE EFFICIENT, CAPPED FLAT PAYMENTS ARE MORE EGALITARIAN. WE ALSO CONSIDER THE CHARACTERISTICS OF COMMUNITIES RECEIVING PAYMENTS FROM BOTH PROGRAMS. WE FIND THAT THE RISK-WEIGHTED SCHEME RESULTS IN MORE PAYMENTS TO POOR COMMUNITIES, AND THAT THESE PAYMENTS ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN THOSE MADE TO NON-POOR EJIDOS. FINALLY, WE SHOW THAT THE RISK OF DEFORESTATION CAN BE PREDICTED QUITE PRECISELY WITH INDICATORS THAT ARE EASILY OBSERVABLE AND THAT CANNOT BE MANIPULATED BY THE COMMUNITY.DOWNLOAD

THE OPTIMAL CONTRACT IS SECOND BEST IN THAT IT ALLOWS FOR RESIDUAL MORAL HAZARD IN BOTH EFFORT AND OUTPUT REPORTING. THE MODEL PREDICTS THAT CONTRACT TERMS WILL VARY WITH THE VALUE TO THE TENANT OF UNREPORTED OUTPUT AS WELL AS WITH ANY CAPACITY OF THE PRINCIPAL TO DIRECTLY SUPERVISE THE AGENT. THE MODEL IS WRITTEN FOR A LANDLORD-TENANT SHARE CONTRACT BUT APPLIES AS WELL FOR TAX COLLECTION AND FRANCHISING.DOWNLOAD

THIS JOINT EFFECT ON DROPOUT AND REPAYMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME NEGATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT CLIENTS AND IS BEING SHARED ACROSS LENDERS.

	CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER PROGRAMS ARE NOW USED EXTENSIVELY TO ENCOURAGE POOR PARENTS TO INCREASE INVESTMENTS IN THEIR CHILDREN’S HUMAN CAPITAL. THESE PROGRAMS CAN BE LARGE AND EXPENSIVE, MOTIVATING A QUEST FOR GREATER EFFICIENCY THROUGH INCREASED IMPACT OF THE PROGRAMS’ IMPOSED CONDITIONS ON HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION. THIS REQUIRES DESIGNING THE PROGRAMS’ TARGETING AND CALIBRATION RULES SPECIFICALLY TO ACHIEVE THIS RESULT. USING DATA FROM THE PROGRESA RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENT IN MEXICO, THIS ARTICLE SHOWS THAT LARGE EFFICIENCY GAINS CAN BE ACHIEVED BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HOW MUCH THE PROBABILITY OF A CHILD’S ENROLLMENT IS AFFECTED BY A CONDITIONAL TRANSFER. RULES FOR TARGETING AND CALIBRATION CAN BE MADE EASY TO IMPLEMENT BY SELECTING INDICATORS THAT ARE SIMPLE, OBSERVABLE, AND VERIFIABLE AND THAT CANNOT BE MANIPULATED BY BENEFICIARIES. THE MEXICO CASE SHOWS THAT THESE EFFICIENCY GAINS CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT INCREASING INEQUALITY AMONG POOR HOUSEHOLDS.DOWNLOAD

	INCOME SHOCKS ON POOR HOUSEHOLDS ARE KNOWN TO INDUCE PARENTS TO TAKE THEIR CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL AND SEND THEM TO WORK WHEN OTHER RISK-COPING INSTRUMENTS ARE INSUFFICIENT. STATE DEPENDENCE IN SCHOOL ATTENDANCE FURTHER IMPLIES THAT THESE RESPONSES TO SHORT-RUN SHOCKS HAVE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES ON CHILDREN’S HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT. CONDITIONAL CASH TRANSFER (CCT) PROGRAMS, WHERE THE CONDITION IS ON SCHOOL ATTENDANCE, HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO BE EFFECTIVE IN INCREASING EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS AND REDUCING CHILD WORK. WE ASK THE QUESTION HERE OF WHETHER OR NOT CHILDREN WHO BENEFIT FROM CONDITIONAL TRANSFERS ARE PROTECTED FROM THE IMPACTS OF SHOCKS ON SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AND WORK. WE DEVELOP A MODEL OF A HOUSEHOLD’S DECISION REGARDING CHILD SCHOOL AND WORK UNDER CONDITIONS OF A SCHOOL RE-ENTRY COST, CONDITIONAL TRANSFERS, AND EXPOSURE TO SHOCKS. WE TAKE MODEL PREDICTIONS TO THE DATA USING A PANEL FROM MEXICO’S PROGRESA EXPERIENCE WITH RANDOMIZED TREATMENT. RESULTS SHOW THAT THERE IS STRONG STATE DEPENDENCE IN SCHOOL ENROLLMENT. WE FIND THAT THE CONDITIONAL TRANSFERS HELPED PROTECT ENROLLMENT, BUT DID NOT REFRAIN PARENTS FROM INCREASING CHILD WORK IN RESPONSE TO SHOCKS. THESE RESULTS REVEAL THAT CCT PROGRAMS CAN PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL BENEFIT TO RECIPIENTS IN ACTING AS SAFETY NETS FOR THE SCHOOLING OF THE POOR.DOWNLOAD

	EXPLAINING LAND USE CHANGE IN MEXICO REQUIRES UNDERSTANDING THE BEHAVIOR OF THE LOCAL INSTITUTIONS INVOLVED. WE DEVELOP TWO THEORIES TO EXPLAIN DEFORESTATION IN COMMUNITIES WITH AND WITHOUT FORESTRY PROJECTS, WHERE THE FORMER INVOLVES A PROCESS OF SIDE PAYMENTS TO NON-MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY AND THE LATTER OF PARTIAL COOPERATION AMONG COMMUNITY MEMBERS. DATA COLLECTED IN 2002 COMBINED WITH SATELLITE IMAGERY ARE USED TO TEST THESE THEORIES. FOR THE FORESTRY VILLAGES, WE ESTABLISH A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DISTRIBUTION OF PROFITS AS DIVIDENDS INSTEAD OF PUBLIC GOODS AND FOREST LOSS. FOR COMMUNITIES NOT ENGAGED IN FORESTRY PROJECTS, DEFORESTATION IS LARGELY RELATED TO THE ABILITY OF THE COMMUNITY TO INDUCE THE FORMATION OF A COALITION OF MEMBERS THAT COOPERATES IN NOT ENCROACHING. THIS HAPPENS MORE EASILY IN SMALLER COMMUNITIES WITH EXPERIENCED LEADERS. A DISTURBING RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS IS THAT DEFORESTATION IS HIGHER WHEN A COMMUNITY ENGAGES IN FORESTRY PROJECTS, EVEN AFTER PROPERLY ACCOUNTING FOR SELF-SELECTION INTO THIS ACTIVITY. THIS SUGGESTS THAT FORESTRY PROJECTS AS THEY NOW EXIST IN MEXICO ARE NOT SUSTAINABLE AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE DEFORESTATION PROBLEM.DOWNLOAD

	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES EFFECTS OF INSECT-RESISTANT BT COTTON ON PESTICIDE USE AND AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTIVITY IN ARGENTINA. BASED ON FARM SURVEY DATA, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE TECHNOLOGY REDUCES APPLICATION RATES OF TOXIC CHEMICALS BY 50 PER CENT, WHILE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASING YIELDS. USING A DAMAGE CONTROL FRAMEWORK, THE EFFECTIVENESS OF BT VERSUS CHEMICAL PESTICIDES IS ESTIMATED, AND TECHNOLOGICAL IMPACTS ARE PREDICTED FOR DIFFERENT FARM TYPES. GROSS BENEFITS COULD BE HIGHEST FOR SMALLHOLDER FARMERS, WHO ARE NOT CURRENTLY USING THE TECHNOLOGY. THE DURABILITY OF THE ADVANTAGES IS ANALYZED BY USING BIOLOGICAL MODELS TO SIMULATE RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT IN PEST POPULATIONS. RAPID RESISTANCE BUILDUP AND ASSOCIATED PEST OUTBREAKS APPEAR TO BE UNLIKELY IF MINIMUM NON-BT REFUGE AREAS ARE MAINTAINED. THUS, PROMOTING A MORE WIDESPREAD DIFFUSION OF BT COTTON COULD AMPLIFY THE EFFICIENCY, EQUITY, AND ENVIRONMENTAL GAINS. CONCLUSIVE STATEMENTS ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY’S SUSTAINABILITY, HOWEVER, REQUIRE LONGER-TERM MONITORING OF POSSIBLE SECONDARY EFFECTS AND FARMERS’ BEHAVIOR IN MAINTAINING REFUGES.DOWNLOAD

FOR SMALLHOLDERS, AN ADDITIONAL HECTARE OF LAND INCREASES WELFARE ON AVERAGE BY 1.3 TIMES THE EARNINGS OF AN AGRICULTURAL WORKER. IN ADDITION, THE MARGINAL WELFARE VALUE OF LAND DEPENDS IMPORTANTLY ON A HOUSEHOLD’S CONTROL OVER COMPLEMENTARY ASSETS SUCH AS EDUCATION AND ON THE CONTEXT WHERE ASSETS ARE USED SUCH AS ROAD ACCESS.DOWNLOAD

ALTERNATIVELY, FOR MUNICIPALITIES FARAWAY FROM URBAN CENTERS, A LARGER PROPORTION OF THE GROWTH IN NON-AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT (IN PARTICULAR IN MANUFACTURE) COMES FROM THE INTERACTION BETWEEN A HIGH-VALUE AGRICULTURE AND AVAILABILITY OF ROADS.DOWNLOAD

	AT ITS INTERNATIONAL CENTRES WEEK IN OCTOBER 2000 (ICW2000), THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP ON INTERNATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH (CGIAR) ADOPTED A NEW VISION AND STRATEGY. THIS PAPERT IS ABOUT PLANK 4 OF THE CGIAR’S VISION AND STRATEGY THAT CALLS FOR THE ADOPTION, IN COLLABORATION WITH NATIONAL AND REGIONAL PARTNERS, OF A REGIONAL APPROACH TO RESEARCH PLANNING, PRIORITY SETTING AND IMPLEMENTATION. GIVEN THE POVERTY AND IMPACT FOCUS OF INTERNATIONAL PUBLIC GOODS RESEARCH, BOTH NARS (NATIONAL AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SYSTEMS) AND THE CGIAR HAVE ADVANTAGES IN PURSUING A REGIONAL APPROACH AS A COMPONENT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ACTIVITIES. FOR THE NARS IN THE REGION, THIS MEANS SEEKING AT THE REGIONAL LEVEL ADVANTAGES THAT THEY COULD NOT DERIVE SOLELY FROM A NATIONAL-LEVEL APPROACH, THUS COMPLEMENTING AND SUPPLEMENTING THE NATIONAL APPROACH. FOR THE CGIAR, THIS MEANS SEEKING COMPLEMENTARY GAINS THAT IT COULD NOT ACHIEVE EXCLUSIVELY THROUGH A GLOBAL OR ECOREGIONAL APPROACH. THESE MUTUAL ADVANTAGES OPEN THE DOOR FOR PARTNERSHIPS IN REGIONAL RESEARCH BETWEEN NARS AND THEIR REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS, AND THE CGIAR. THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THE ADVANTAGES AS WELL AS RISKS AND LIMITATIONS OF A REGIONAL APPROACH TO RESEARCH. SINCE ICW2000, ALL REGIONAL AND SUB-REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND CGIAR CENTRES HAVE TAKEN ACTION TO FACILITATE REGIONAL CONSULTATION PROCESSES THAT COULD EVENTUALLY LEAD TO ESTABLISHING A REGIONAL APPROACH TO RESEARCH FOR THE CGIAR AND NARS. THE PAPER NOTES SOME EMERGING LESSONS, AND TAKES A FORWARD LOOK.DOWNLOAD

	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES ADOPTION AND IMPACTS OF BT COTTON IN ARGENTINA AGAINST THE BACKGROUND OF MONOPOLY PRICING. BASED ON SURVEY DATA, IT IS SHOWN THAT THE TECHNOLOGY SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCES INSECTICIDE APPLICATIONS AND INCREASES YIELDS; HOWEVER, THESE ADVANTAGES ARE CURBED BY THE HIGH PRICE CHARGED FOR GENETICALLY MODIFIED (GM) SEEDS. STUDIES SHOW THAT FARMERS’ AVERAGE WILLINGNESS TO PAY IS LESS THAN HALF THE ACTUAL TECHNOLOGY PRICE. A LOWER PRICE WOULD NOT ONLY INCREASE BENEFITS FOR GROWERS, BUT COULD ALSO MULTIPLY COMPANY PROFITS.DOWNLOAD

	USING SURVEY-DATA FROM PERU, THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE IMPACT OF A PILOT FARMERFIELD-SCHOOL (FFS) PROGRAM ON FARMERS’ KNOWLEDGE OF INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT (IPM) PRACTICES RELATED TO POTATO CULTIVATION. WE USE BOTH REGRESSION ANALYSIS CONTROLLING FOR PARTICIPATION AND A PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING
	APPROACH TO CREATE A COMPARISON GROUP SIMILAR TO THE FFS PARTICIPANTS IN OBSERVABLE CHARACTERISTICS. RESULTS ARE ROBUST ACROSS THE TWO APPROACHES AS WELL
	AS WITH DIFFERENT MATCHING METHODS. WE FIND THAT FARMERS WHO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IPM PRACTICES THAN THOSE IN THE NON-PARTICIPANT COMPARISON GROUP. WE ALSO FIND SUGGESTIVE EVIDENCE THAT IMPROVED KNOWLEDGE ABOUT IPM PRACTICES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY IN POTATO PRODUCTION.DOWNLOAD

	BT COTTON WAS AMONG THE FIRST TRANSGENIC CROPS TO BE USED IN COMMERCIAL AGRICULTURE. A GENE FROM THE SOIL BACTERIUM BACILLUS THURINGIENSIS (BT) HAS BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE COTTON GENOME. THIS GENE CODES FOR PRODUCTION OF A PROTEIN THAT IS TOXIC TO THE COTTON BOLLWORM, A SEVERE INSECT PEST IN MOST COTTON-GROWING REGIONS OF THE WORLD. IN THE UNITED STATES AND CHINA, BT COTTON WAS COMMERCIALIZED IN THE MID-1990S, AND TODAY, THE TECHNOLOGY COVERS AROUND 30-40% OF THE COTTON AREA IN BOTH COUNTRIES. RECENT STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT US AND CHINESE BT ADOPTERS REALIZE SIGNIFICANT PESTICIDE AND COST SAVINGS (CARPENTER ET AL., 2002; PRAY, HUANG, HU, & ROZELLE, 2002). BENEFITS OF BT COTTON HAVE ALSO BEEN REPORTED FOR SOUTH AFRICA (SHANKAR & THIRTLE, 2003) AND MEXICO (TRAXLER, GODOY-AVILA, FALCK-ZEPEDA, & ESPINOZA-ARELLAN, 2001). NONETHELESS, THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THE TECHNOLOGYÍS IMPACTS AND SUSTAINABILITY UNDER DIFFERENT AGROECOLOGICAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE IMPLICATIONS OF BT COTTON IN ARGENTINA, WHERE THE TECHNOLOGY WAS COMMERCIALIZED BY MONSANTO IN 1998. UNLIKE OTHER BT-GROWING COUNTRIES, WHERE COTTON IS A HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED CROP, ARGENTINA IS PRODUCING UNDER FREE-TRADE CONDITIONS, WITH COMPARATIVELY LOW INPUT INTENSITIES AND PRODUCTION COSTS. THIS MIGHT INFLUENCE THE TECHNOLOGYÍS AGRONOMIC OUTCOME. APART FROM A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF PESTICIDE USE AND YIELDS WITH AND WITHOUT BT, PRODUCTIVITY EFFECTS ARE MODELED ECONOMETRICALLY USING A DAMAGE CONTROL SPECIFICATION. THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED ON A COMPREHENSIVE SURVEY OF ARGENTINE COTTON FARMERS IN 2001 DONE JOINTLY WITH ARGENTINAÍS NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR FARMING AND LIVESTOCK TECHNOLOGY (INTA). ALTHOUGH SHORT-RUN GAINS OF THE TECHNOLOGY ARE INCREASINGLY RECOGNIZED (QAIM & ZILBERMAN, 2003), LONG-RUN EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH PEST RESISTANCE REMAIN IN DOUBT. WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BY USING BIOLOGICAL MODELS TO SIMULATE POSSIBLE RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT IN BOLLWORM POPULATIONS. ALTHOUGH RESISTANCE BUILDUP HAS NOT BEEN OBSERVED IN THE FIELD SO FAR, BIOCHEMICAL STUDIES INDICATE A HIGH RISK OF RAPID INSECT ADAPTATION TO THE BT TOXIN (GOULD, 1998). RESISTANCE DEVELOPMENT IS ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS OF ENVIRONMENTALISTS WITH RESPECT TO BT CROPS. IT WOULD NOT ONLY CHALLENGE THE TECHNOLOGYÍS SUSTAINABILITY, BUT WOULD ALSO IMPLY LOSS OF BT AS AN ECOLOGICALLY FRIENDLY MICROBIAL INSECTICIDE THAT IS WIDELY USED IN ORGANIC AGRICULTURE.DOWNLOAD

EMPIRICAL RESULTS SHOW THAT YIELD INCREASES IN FOOD CROPS HELP FOODBUYING FARM HOUSEHOLDS IMPORT SUBSTITUTE IN FOOD CONSUMPTION, REDUCE LIVESTOCK PRODUCTION, AND INCREASE SEASONAL MIGRATION WHICH IS MORE COMPATIBLE WITH SEASONAL AGRICULTURE THAN WITH THE YEARLONG LIVESTOCK ACTIVITY. SELF-SUFFICIENT HOUSEHOLDS, BY CONTRAST, CAN TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIGHER YIELDS TO FREE RESOURCES FROM FOOD PRODUCTION AND ALLOCATE THESE TO EXPAND THEIR LIVESTOCK ECONOMY, THUS BENEFITING MORE FROM THE REGION’S COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE. WE ALSO SHOW THAT GREATER EFFECTIVENESS IN COOPERATION IN THE MANAGEMENT OF COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES HELPS INCREASE INCOME DERIVED FROM LIVESTOCK FOR ALL CATEGORIES OF HOUSEHOLDS. HOWEVER, NOT ALL FORMS OF COOPERATION ARE EFFECTIVE. WHEN COOPERATION IS ONLY FORMAL, INDIVIDUAL ACTIVITIES SUCH AS CROPS, NON-AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYMENT, AND SEASONAL MIGRATION ARE PURSUED AS OPPOSED TO LIVESTOCK ACTIVITIES THAT RELY ON EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY MANAGEMENT OF COMMON PROPERTY RESOURCES.DOWNLOAD

	REGIONALIZATION OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH ACROSS COUNTRIES HAS RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN RECENT YEARS, WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF REGIONAL AND SUB-REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS IN MOST REGIONS. RECENTLY, THE CGIAR SYSTEM HAS CALLED FOR A REGIONAL APPROACH TO RESEARCH INVOLVING BOTTOM-UP PRIORITY-SETTING AND IMPLEMENTATION, AND INTEGRATING THIS WITH GLOBAL PRIORITY-SETTING. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPING AN APPROACH FOR RESEARCH PRIORITY-SETTING THAT WOULD SATISFY NATIONAL, REGIONAL AND GLOBAL EXPECTATIONS OF REGIONALIZATION AND ALLOW THE REGIONAL AND SUB-REGIONAL ORGANIZATIONS TO ASSUME A BIGGER ROLE. THE PAPER ALSO CONSIDERS HOW THE CGIAR CENTRES MAY SUPPORT THIS PRIORITY-SETTING PROCESS AND HOW THEY MAY USE IT TO DEFINE THEIR REGIONAL ACTIVITIES. A REVIEW OF EXISTING REGIONAL RESEARCH INITIATIVES SHOW THE MANY MODELS IN USE, WITH DIFFERENT EXTENTS OF COLLABORATION, AND WITH DIFFERENT CHALLENGES AND PROMISES. REGIONAL PRIORITIES CAN STRENGTHEN THE RELEVANCE OF AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH IN A REGION OR SUB-REGION. A DESCRIPTION OF A RELATIVELY GENERIC APPROACH TO ESTABLISHING REGIONAL PRIORITIES IS PRESENTED. DIFFERENT RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE PRESENT IN A REGION CAN USE THE RESEARCH PRIORITIES TO ENABLE THEIR WORK, AND IT IS POSSIBLE FOR CGIAR CENTRES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE REGIONAL AGENDA WHILE RESPECTING THE GLOBAL NATURE OF THE CGIAR SYSTEM. THE INTEGRATION OF REGIONAL PRIORITIES INTO THE CGIAR GLOBAL RESEARCH AGENDA IS AN AREA WHERE THERE IS LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN THE CGIAR SYSTEM. THE CHALLENGE FOR THE CGIAR IS TO DETERMINE HOW TO MAINTAIN A GLOBAL FOCUS IN ITS AGENDA WHILE PROMOTING A COORDINATED REGIONAL APPROACH TO RESEARCH PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION. PRIORITY-SETTING IN THE CGIAR WILL BECOME EVEN MORE OF AN ONGOING PROCESS WHILE THE BOTTOM-UP REGIONAL APPROACH TO RESEARCH PLANNING, PRIORITY-SETTING AND IMPLEMENTATION IS ESTABLISHED IN ALL REGIONS.DOWNLOAD

ALICIA MENENDEZ|ALICIA S. MENENDEZ IS A RESEARCH ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO HARRIS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY AND A PRINCIPAL RESEARCH SCIENTIST AT NORC AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO.  DR. MENENDEZ IS A DEVELOPMENT ECONOMIST. HER RESEARCH INTERESTS INCLUDE EDUCATION AND HEALTH, LABOR MARKETS, AND HOUSEHOLD BEHAVIOR. DR. MENENDEZ HAS DESIGNED AND MANAGED NUMEROUS QUANTITATIVE IMPACT EVALUATIONS AND QUALITATIVE EVALUATIONS, AND HAS DEVELOPED TOOLS AND OVERSEEN SURVEYS IN NUMEROUS DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. MENENDEZ RECEIVED HER PH.D. IN ECONOMICS FROM BOSTON UNIVERSITY. BEFORE COMING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, SHE WAS A LECTURER IN PUBLIC AND INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS AT THE WOODROW WILSON SCHOOL AND A RESEARCHER AT THE RESEARCH PROGRAM IN DEVELOPMENT STUDIES AT PRINCETON UNIVERSITY. (WITH U. HOADLEY AND A. SOLOVYEVA) WHILE MANY LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES HAVE DEMONSTRATED IMPRESSIVE PROGRESS IN ACCESS TO EDUCATION, THIS PROGRESS HAS NOT YET BEEN MATCHED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. THE RESEARCH REPORTED IN THIS PAPER EXAMINED THE IMPACT OF THE READ LIBERIA INTERVENTION, A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDED TEACHER TRAINING AND COACHING, TEACHING AND LEARNING MATERIALS, AND COMMUNITY OUTREACH, AND REACHED 57,600 STUDENTS IN GRADE 1 AND 2 IN 640 SCHOOLS. WE EXPLOITED THE RANDOMIZED ASSIGNMENT OF SCHOOLS TO THE PROGRAM AND FOUND A LARGE POSITIVE EFFECT ON STUDENTS' ABILITY TO READ AND UNDERSTAND GRADE-APPROPRIATE TEXT. LITERACY (ORAL READING FLUENCY AND ORAL READING COMPREHENSION) AMONG STUDENTS IN THE TREATMENT SCHOOLS DOUBLED, ON AVERAGE, COMPARED TO THE CONTROL SCHOOLS. BASED ON THE ANALYSIS OF THE PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION DATA, WE ARGUE THAT IMPROVEMENTS IN READING PERFORMANCE ARE DRIVEN BY THE AVAILABILITY AND UTILIZATION OF READ LIBERIA READING MATERIALS AND NOT BY IMPROVED TEACHING PRACTICES AT SCHOOLS. THIS CONFIRMS RESEARCH LITERATURE SUGGESTING IN CONTRAST TO PREVIOUS LITERATURE, THIS SUGGESTS THAT HIGH-QUALITY, AND WELL-LEVELED LEARNING MATERIALS IN THE HANDS OF STUDENTS MAY HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON READING SKILLS INDEPENDENT OF CHANGES IN INSTRUCTIONAL PRACTICE.   (WITH ALEJANDRO OME)  EDUCATION ECONOMICS WE EVALUATE AN INTERVENTION USING SMS MESSAGING TO SEND SHORT STORIES TO 2ND AND 3RD GRADERS IN ZAMBIA’S EASTERN PROVINCE, AIMED AT IMPROVING READING SKILLS. FOR NINE MONTHS HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVED THREE TEXT MESSAGES WEEKLY COMPRISING A SHORT STORY FOR CHILDREN TO READ WITH THEIR FAMILIES, AND A QUESTION ABOUT THE STORY. ADDITIONALLY, PARENTS ATTENDED MONTHLY MEETINGS AIMED TO ADDRESS ANY PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND ENCOURAGE READING. THE PROGRAM HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON READING SKILLS, BETWEEN 19 AND 28 PERCENT OF A STANDARD DEVIATION. A COST-EFFECTIVENESS ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT EXPANDING THE PROGRAM NATIONALLY WOULD COST USD 20–22 PER CHILD.

CLOCK   OFFICE HOURSBY APPOINTMENTDOWNLOAD DOWNLOAD A PDF (222KB, UPDATED 07-12-2022)AMERICAN GOVERNMENT IS IN THE MIDST OF A REPUTATION CRISIS. AN OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF CITIZENS—REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ALIKE—HOLD NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS OF THE GOVERNMENT AND BELIEVE IT IS WASTEFUL, INEFFICIENT, AND DOING A GENERALLY POOR JOB MANAGING PUBLIC PROGRAMS AND PROVIDING PUBLIC SERVICES. WHEN SOCIAL PROBLEMS ARISE, AMERICANS ARE THEREFORE SKEPTICAL THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS THE ABILITY TO RESPOND EFFECTIVELY. IT’S A SERIOUS PROBLEM, ARGUES AMY E. LERMAN, AND IT WILL NOT BE A SIMPLE ONE TO FIX.WITH GOOD ENOUGH FOR GOVERNMENT WORK, LERMAN USES SURVEYS, EXPERIMENTS, AND PUBLIC OPINION DATA TO ARGUE PERSUASIVELY THAT THE REPUTATION OF GOVERNMENT IS ITSELF AN IMPEDIMENT TO GOVERNMENT’S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE THE COMMON GOOD. IN ADDITION TO IMPROVING ITS EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS, GOVERNMENT THEREFORE HAS AN EQUALLY CRITICAL TASK: COUNTERING THE BELIEF THAT THE PUBLIC SECTOR IS MIRED IN INCOMPETENCE. LERMAN TAKES READERS THROUGH THE MAIN CHALLENGES. NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS ARE HIGHLY RESISTANT TO CHANGE, SHE SHOWS, BECAUSE WE TEND TO PERCEIVE THE WORLD IN A WAY THAT CONFIRMS OUR NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES OF GOVERNMENT—EVEN IN THE FACE OF NEW INFORMATION. THOSE WHO HOLD PARTICULARLY NEGATIVE PERCEPTIONS ALSO BEGIN TO “OPT OUT” IN FAVOR OF PRIVATE ALTERNATIVES, SUCH AS SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS, LIVING IN GATED COMMUNITIES, AND REFUSING TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAMS. WHEN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF PEOPLE OPT OUT OF PUBLIC SERVICES, THE RESULT CAN BE A DECLINE IN THE OBJECTIVE QUALITY OF PUBLIC PROVISION. IN THIS WAY, CITIZENS’ BELIEFS ABOUT GOVERNMENT CAN QUICKLY BECOME A SELF-FULFILLING PROPHECY, WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR ALL. LERMAN CONCLUDES WITH PRACTICAL SOLUTIONS FOR HOW THE GOVERNMENT MIGHT IMPROVE ITS REPUTATION AND ROLL BACK CURRENT EFFORTS TO ELIMINATE OR PRIVATIZE EVEN SOME OF THE MOST CRITICAL PUBLIC SERVICES.IN JUST FOUR DECADES, THE SIZE OF THE U.S. STATE PRISON POPULATION GREW BY MORE THAN 700 PERCENT. BY 2008, THE NUMBER OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS IN THE UNITED STATES HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH, WITH 1 IN 100 ADULTS IN EITHER PRISON OR JAIL AND FULLY 1 IN EVERY 31 AMERICAN ADULTS UNDER SOME FORM OF CORRECTIONAL JURISDICTION (INCLUDING INCARCERATION, PROBATION, AND PAROLE).RESEARCHERS HAVE NOTED THESE PATTERNS AND TRENDS WITH ALARM. YET WHILE EXPANSIVE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED ON CORRECTIONAL SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES, MOST OF THIS WORK BEGINS AND ENDS WITH A FOCUS ON THE INCARCERATED. MUCH OF THE EARLY LITERATURE EITHER IGNORES CORRECTIONAL PERSONNEL ALTOGETHER, OR PAINTS AN OVERLY SIMPLISTIC PICTURE. WHILE INTEREST IN THOSE WHO WORK INSIDE AMERICAN PRISONS HAS BEGUN TO GROW, WE STILL KNOW SURPRISINGLY LITTLE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO CORRECTIONAL PERSONNEL AS A FUNCTION OF SPENDING A CAREER INSIDE THE PRISON SYSTEM.LIKE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE INCARCERATED, THE RANKS OF PEOPLE EMPLOYED BY THE U.S. CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAVE INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY. AS OF 2003, ALMOST 13 PERCENT OF ALL PUBLIC EMPLOYEES (AND A LARGER PERCENTAGE IN 15 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA) WORKED IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SECTOR. CORRECTIONS ALONE ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN 63 PERCENT OF STATE CRIMINAL JUSTICE EMPLOYEES, WITH POLICE PROTECTION AND JUDICIAL/LEGAL EMPLOYEES ACCOUNTING FOR THE OTHER 14 AND 22 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. IN RECENT YEARS, THE CORRECTIONAL SYSTEM HAS EMPLOYED MORE PEOPLE THAN GENERAL MOTORS, FORD, AND WAL-MART COMBINED.ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE PRISON SYSTEM, CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS, PERHAPS MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE PRACTICE OF INCARCERATION IN THE WAY THAT THEY PERFORM THEIR JOBS. BECAUSE OF THIS, CORRECTIONAL PROGRAMS AND POLICIES CAN HAVE LITTLE CHANCE OF SUCCESS WITHOUT THEIR OVERALL HEALTH. THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN CONSIDERING THE MISSION OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION (CDCR) AND ITS GOALS OF PROMOTING PUBLIC SAFETY THROUGH A PROFESSIONAL STAFF, AS WELL AS A CONSTRUCTIVE CORRECTIONAL AND REHABILITATION ENVIRONMENT. UNDERSTANDING THAT CORRECTIONAL WORK CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE WELL-BEING OF BOTH INMATES AND CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS, THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION (CCPOA), THE CCPOA BENEFIT TRUST FUND (BTF), AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION (CDCR) HAVE JOINED FORCES WITH RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY (UCB) TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT HEALTH AND WELLNESS.AS A STARTING POINT, DR. AMY E. LERMAN AND HER TEAM AT UCB DEVELOPED THE CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL OFFICER SURVEY (CCOS). THE CCOS IS A LARGE-SCALE EFFORT TO GATHER INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL INFORMATION ON THE THOUGHTS, ATTITUDES, AND EXPERIENCES OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE PERSONNEL. THE CCOS WAS FIRST CONDUCTED IN 2006, AND THE INSTRUMENT WAS THEN EXPANDED AND REPLICATED FROM MARCH TO MAY OF 2017. THE MOST RECENT SURVEY INCLUDES A SAMPLE OF 8,334 OFFICERS AND OTHER SWORN STAFF, PROVIDING A VAST CROSS-SECTION OF OFFICERS ACROSS ALL OF CALIFORNIA’S CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND PAROLE OFFICES.THIS REPORT SUMMARIZES THE RESULTS OF THE CCOS ACROSS A SET OF BROAD BUT RELATED CATEGORIES: MENTAL AND PHYSICAL WELLNESS; EXPOSURE TO VIOLENCE; ATTITUDES TOWARDS REHABILITATION AND PUNISHMENT; JOB TRAINING AND MANAGEMENT; WORK-LIFE BALANCE; AND TRAINING AND SUPPORT.DOWNLOAD 
									OFFICER HEALTH AND WELLNESS (203KB)ACLAND, D., LERMAN, A. (2018), AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCHPARTY POLARIZATION IS A CENTRAL FEATURE OF AMERICAN POLITICAL LIFE, AND A ROBUST LITERATURE HAS SHOWN THAT CITIZENS ENGAGE IN PARTISAN-CONFIRMATION BIAS WHEN PROCESSING POLITICAL INFORMATION. AT THE SAME TIME, HOWEVER, RECENT EVENTS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED A RISING TIDE OF ANTI-GOVERNMENT POPULISM THAT MANIFESTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE. IN FACT, DATA SHOW THAT LARGE PROPORTIONS OF BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS HOLD NEGATIVE VIEWS OF GOVERNMENT. USING AN ORIGINAL SET OF SURVEY EXPERIMENTS, WE EXAMINE THE PSYCHOLOGY OF PUBLIC-SECTOR EVALUATION. WE FIND THAT CITIZENS ENGAGE IN A PROCESS OF CONFIRMATION BIAS WHEN THEY ENCOUNTER NEW INFORMATION, WHICH IS DRIVEN NOT BY PARTY AND IDEOLOGY BUT BY BELIEFS ABOUT THE QUALITY AND EFFICIENCY OF GOVERNMENT. TAKEN TOGETHER, OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST IMPORTANT LIMITATIONS TO CITIZENS’ CAPACITY TO LEARN ABOUT PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, AND EXPAND OUR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT DRIVES CONFIRMATION BIAS WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SERVICE PROVISION.DOWNLOAD

HOWEVER, WE DO NOT YET KNOW WHETHER PARTY SIMILARLY PLAYS A ROLE IN SHAPING PUBLIC POLICY BEHAVIOR, SUCH AS WHETHER TO APPLY FOR GOVERNMENT BENEFITS OR TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PUBLIC SERVICES. WHILE EXISTING RESEARCH HAS IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS FACTORS THAT INCREASE POLICY UPTAKE, THE ROLE OF POLITICS HAS BEEN ALMOST ENTIRELY OVERLOOKED. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE THE CASE OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT TO ASSESS WHETHER POLICY UPTAKE IS NOT ONLY ABOUT INFORMATION AND INCENTIVES; BUT ALSO ABOUT POLITICS. USING LONGITUDINAL DATA, WE FIND THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE BEEN LESS LIKELY THAN DEMOCRATS TO ENROLL IN AN INSURANCE PLAN THROUGH STATE OR FEDERAL EXCHANGES, ALL ELSE EQUAL. EMPLOYING A LARGE-SCALE FIELD EXPERIMENT, WE THEN SHOW THAT DE-EMPHASIZING THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT (AND HIGHLIGHTING THE MARKET'S ROLE) CAN CLOSE THIS PARTISAN GAP.DOWNLOAD

THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO PRESS, 2014.THE NUMBERS ARE STAGGERING: ONE-THIRD OF AMERICA’S ADULT POPULATION HAS PASSED THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND NOW HAS A CRIMINAL RECORD. MANY MORE WERE NEVER CONVICTED, BUT ARE NONETHELESS SUBJECT TO SURVEILLANCE BY THE STATE. NEVER BEFORE HAS THE AMERICAN GOVERNMENT MAINTAINED SO VAST A NETWORK OF INSTITUTIONS DEDICATED SOLELY TO THE CONTROL AND CONFINEMENT OF ITS CITIZENS.A PROVOCATIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE CONTEMPORARY CARCERAL STATE FOR AMERICAN DEMOCRACY, ARRESTING CITIZENSHIP ARGUES THAT THE BROAD REACH OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS FUNDAMENTALLY RECAST THE RELATION BETWEEN CITIZEN AND STATE, RESULTING IN A SIZABLE—AND GROWING—GROUP OF SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. FROM POLICE STOPS TO COURT CASES AND INCARCERATION, AT EACH STAGE OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM INDIVIDUALS BELONGING TO THIS DISEMPOWERED GROUP COME TO EXPERIENCE A STATE-WITHIN-A-STATE THAT REFLECTS FEW OF THE COUNTRY’S CORE DEMOCRATIC VALUES. THROUGH SCORES OF INTERVIEWS, ALONG WITH ANALYSES OF SURVEY DATA, AMY E. LERMAN AND VESLA M. WEAVER SHOW HOW THIS CONTACT WITH POLICE, COURTS, AND PRISONS DECREASES FAITH IN THE CAPACITY OF AMERICAN POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS TO RESPOND TO CITIZENS’ CONCERNS AND DIMINISHES THE SENSE OF FULL AND EQUAL CITIZENSHIP—EVEN FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND GUILTY OF ANY CRIME. THE EFFECTS OF THIS INCREASINGLY FREQUENT CONTACT WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ARE WIDE-RANGING—AND PERNICIOUS—AND LERMAN AND WEAVER GO ON TO OFFER CONCRETE PROPOSALS FOR REFORMS TO REINCORPORATE THIS LARGE GROUP OF CITIZENS AS ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN AMERICAN CIVIC AND POLITICAL LIFE.
LERMAN, AMY E. THE MODERN PRISON PARADOX: POLITICS, PUNISHMENT, AND SOCIAL COMMUNITY. CAMBRIDGE UP, 2013.
	IN THE MODERN PRISON PARADOX, AMY E. LERMAN EXAMINES THE SHIFT FROM REHABILITATION TO PUNITIVISM THAT HAS TAKEN PLACE IN THE POLITICS AND PRACTICE OF AMERICAN CORRECTIONS. SHE ARGUES THAT THIS PUNITIVE TURN HAS HAD PROFOUNDLY NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES FOR BOTH CRIME CONTROL AND AMERICAN COMMUNITY LIFE. PROFESSOR LERMAN'S RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SPENDING TIME IN AMERICA'S INCREASINGLY VIOLENT AND CASTIGATORY PRISONS STRENGTHENS INMATES' CRIMINAL NETWORKS AND FOSTERS ATTITUDES THAT INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF CRIMINAL ACTIVITY FOLLOWING PAROLE. ADDITIONALLY, PROFESSOR LERMAN ASSESSES WHETHER AMERICA'S MORE PUNITIVE PRISONS SIMILARLY SHAPE THE SOCIAL ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS OF CORRECTIONAL STAFF. HER ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT WORKING IN MORE PUNITIVE PRISONS CAUSES CORRECTIONAL OFFICERS TO DEVELOP AN “US AGAINST THEM” MENTALITY WHILE ON THE JOB, AND THAT THE STRESS AND WARINESS OFFICERS ACQUIRE AT WORK CARRIES OVER INTO THEIR PERSONAL LIVES, STRAINING RELATIONSHIPS WITH PARTNERS, CHILDREN, AND FRIENDS.SLATE, DECEMBER 23, 2014WIRED, JULY 11, 2022USA TODAY, JUNE 14, 2017THE MARSHALL PROJECT, JUNE 14, 2017HENRY E.

ULTIMATELY, THIS LINE OF WORK AIMS TO SHED LIGHT ON HOW SHOULD, AND CAN, A GOVERNMENT GO FROM RAISING 5-10 PERCENT OF GDP IN TAXES TO AROUND 35-40 PERCENT, WHILE ENCOURAGING DEVELOPMENT MORE BROADLY. MY SECOND LINE OF WORK CONSISTS IN WORKING WITH TAX AUTHORITIES AND OTHER GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. THE STARTING POINT HERE IS THE SPECIFIC STRUCTURE, POLICIES AND ISSUES OF A GIVEN COUNTRY. THROUGH CLOSE COLLABORATIONS AND THE USE OF LARGE MICRO-DATASETS, THESE PROJECTS STUDY WHAT GOVERNMENTS CAN DO, GIVEN CONSTRAINED CAPACITY TO TAX, TO INCREMENTALLY IMPROVE TAX ADMINISTRATION, TAX ENFORCEMENT, TAX POLICY, AND TAX MORALE.

BOOKS SHAPE HOW CHILDREN LEARN ABOUT SOCIETY AND NORMS, IN PART THROUGH REPRESENTATION OF DIFFERENT CHARACTERS. WE USE COMPUTATIONAL TOOLS TO CHARACTERIZE REPRESENTATION IN CHILDREN’S BOOKS WIDELY READ IN HOMES, CLASSROOMS, AND LIBRARIES OVER THE LAST CENTURY, AND DESCRIBE ECONOMIC FORCES THAT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THESE PATTERNS. WE INTRODUCE NEW ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE METHODS FOR SYSTEMATICALLY CONVERTING IMAGES INTO DATA. WE APPLY THESE TOOLS, ALONGSIDE TEXT ANALYSIS METHODS, TO MEASURE SKIN COLOR, RACE, GENDER, AND AGE IN THE CONTENT OF THESE BOOKS, DOCUMENTING WHAT HAS CHANGED AND WHAT HAS ENDURED OVER TIME. WE FIND UNDERREPRESENTATION OF BLACK AND LATINX PEOPLE IN THE MOST INFLUENTIAL BOOKS, RELATIVE TO THEIR POPULATION SHARES, THOUGH REPRESENTATION OF BLACK INDIVIDUALS INCREASES OVER TIME. FEMALES ARE ALSO INCREASINGLY PRESENT BUT APPEAR LESS OFTEN IN TEXT THAN IN IMAGES, SUGGESTING GREATER SYMBOLIC INCLUSION IN PICTURES THAN SUBSTANTIVE INCLUSION IN STORIES. CHARACTERS IN THESE INFLUENTIAL BOOKS HAVE LIGHTER AVERAGE SKIN COLOR THAN IN OTHER BOOKS, EVEN AFTER CONDITIONING ON RACE, AND CHILDREN ARE DEPICTED WITH LIGHTER SKIN COLOR THAN ADULTS ON AVERAGE. WE THEN PRESENT EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF RELATED ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE REPRESENTATION WE FIND IN THESE BOOKS. ON THE DEMAND SIDE, WE SHOW THAT PEOPLE CONSUME BOOKS THAT CENTER THEIR OWN IDENTITIES, AND THAT THE TYPES OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS PURCHASED CORRELATE WITH LOCAL POLITICAL BELIEFS. ON THE SUPPLY SIDE, WE DOCUMENT HIGHER PRICES FOR BOOKS THAT CENTER NON-DOMINANT SOCIAL IDENTITIES AND FEWER COPIES OF THESE BOOKS IN LIBRARIES THAT SERVE PREDOMINANTLY WHITE COMMUNITIES.  [REPLICATION FILES]         [SLIDES]         [TWITTER THREAD]         [RESEARCH BRIEF]         [AI RESEARCH BRIEF (SSN)]         [VIDEO]         [POSTER]         [INTERACTIVE FIGURES]         [GOOGLE CASE STUDY]        [BROOKINGS CHALKBOARD]         [IZA ARTICLE]       [PRESS: TIME MAGAZINE, SCHOOL LIBRARY JOURNAL, WALL STREET JOURNAL, CODE TOGETHER, INEQUALITALKS, FUTUREED, THE 74, PARENTDATA, NEW YORK TIMES, THE ECONOMIST]         [RECOGNITION: NAMED ONE OF THE TEN MOST SIGNIFICANT EDUCATION STUDIES OF 2021 BY GEORGE LUCAS FOUNDATION'S EDUTOPIA, RECEIVED THE 2021 EARLY CAREER AWARD FROM THE EDUCATION POLICY COLLABORATIVE, RECEIVED THE FIRST PLACE POSTER PRIZE AT APPAM 2021, RECEIVED THE 2021 GOOGLE CUSTOMER AWARD FOR EDUCATION AND THE 2021 GOOGLE CUSTOMER AWARD FOR DIVERSITY, EQUITY & INCLUSION, RECEIVED THE 2023 MINDBYTES DATA VISUALIZATION AWARD, FEATURED ON BEST OF #ECONTWITTER] ""FROM RETRIBUTIVE TO RESTORATIVE: AN ALTERNATIVE APPROACH TO JUSTICE"" (WITH B.

ASHER Ⓡ K. JHA Ⓡ P. NOVOSAD Ⓡ B. TAN) (JUNE 2023, WORKING PAPER)
RAPID URBANIZATION IN LOWER-INCOME COUNTRIES HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENTS IN WELL-BEING, BUT THE RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION OF MARGINALIZED GROUPS COULD REINFORCE INEQUALITY AND LIMIT ACCESS TO NEW OPPORTUNITIES. WE STUDY RESIDENTIAL SEGREGATION, ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES, AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES ACROSS 1.5 MILLION URBAN AND RURAL NEIGHBORHOODS FOR TWO OF INDIA’S MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES: SCHEDULED CASTES (SCS) AND MUSLIMS. LEVELS OF URBAN SEGREGATION IN INDIA ARE COMPARABLE TO BLACK/WHITE SEGREGATION IN THE UNITED STATES. WITHIN CITIES, PUBLIC FACILITIES AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE ARE SYSTEMATICALLY ALLOCATED AWAY FROM NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE MANY MUSLIMS AND SCHEDULES CASTES LIVE. NEARLY ALL OF THE REGRESSIVE ALLOCATION IS ACROSS NEIGHBORHOODS WITHIN CITIES—AT THE MOST INFORMAL AND LEAST STUDIED FORM OF GOVERNMENT. THESE INEQUALITIES ARE ALSO NOT VISIBLE IN THE MORE AGGREGATED DATA TYPICALLY USED TO STUDY UNEQUAL SERVICE ALLOCATION. CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS GROWING UP IN MARGINALIZED GROUP NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE LESS SCHOOLING, EVEN AFTER CONTROLLING FOR PARENT EDUCATION AND HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION. UNEQUAL ACCESS TO PUBLIC SERVICES IN INDIA’S HIGHLY SEGREGATED NEIGHBORHOODS MAY BE A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO DISADVANTAGES FACED BY MARGINALIZED GROUPS.   [SUMMARY]         [FACT SHEET]         [TWITTER SUMMARY]        [PRESS: THE WIRE, THE INDIAN EXPRESS, THE PRINT, GK TODAY, COUNTERVIEW, HINDUSTAN TIMES, ARTICLE14] ""TALES AND TROPES: GENDER ROLES FROM WORD EMBEDDINGS IN A CENTURY OF CHILDREN’S BOOKS"" (WITH P.

THE MANNER IN WHICH GENDER IS PORTRAYED IN MATERIALS USED TO TEACH CHILDREN CONVEYS MESSAGES ABOUT PEOPLE’S ROLES IN SOCIETY. IN THIS PAPER, WE MEASURE THE GENDERED DEPICTION OF CENTRAL DOMAINS OF SOCIAL LIFE IN 100 YEARS OF HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL CHILDREN’S BOOKS. WE MAKE TWO MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS: (1) WE FIND THAT THE PORTRAYAL OF GENDER IN THESE BOOKS REPRODUCES TRADITIONAL GENDER NORMS IN SOCIETY, AND (2) WE PUBLISH STORYWORDS 1.0, THE FIRST WORD EMBEDDINGS TRAINED ON SUCH A LARGE BODY OF CHILDREN'S LITERATURE. WE FIND THAT, RELATIVE TO MALES, FEMALES ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE REPRESENTED IN RELATION TO THEIR APPEARANCE THAN IN RELATION TO THEIR COMPETENCE; SECOND, THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE REPRESENTED IN RELATION TO THEIR ROLE IN THE FAMILY THAN THEIR ROLE IN BUSINESS. FINALLY, WE FIND THAT NON-BINARY OR GENDER-FLUID INDIVIDUALS ARE RARELY MENTIONED. OUR ANALYSIS ADVANCES UNDERSTANDING OF THE DIFFERENT MESSAGES CONTAINED IN CONTENT COMMONLY USED TO TEACH CHILDREN, WITH IMMEDIATE APPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE, POLICY, AND RESEARCH.

RAJ) (JUNE 2022, PROCEEDINGS OF THE ACM SIGCAS/SIGCHI CONFERENCE ON COMPUTING AND SUSTAINABLE SOCIETIES (ACM COMPASS '22))
THE WAY THAT PEOPLE OF DIFFERENT IDENTITIES ARE PORTRAYED IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS CAN SEND SUBCONSCIOUS MESSAGES ABOUT HOW POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY CHILDREN SHOULD THINK ABOUT PEOPLE WITH THOSE IDENTITIES. THESE MESSAGES CAN THEN SHAPE THE NEXT GENERATION'S PERCEPTIONS AND ATTITUDES ABOUT PEOPLE, WHICH CAN HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR BELIEF FORMATION AND RESOURCE ALLOCATION. IN THIS PAPER, WE MAKE TWO CONTRIBUTIONS: (1) WE EXAMINE THE DEPICTION OF RACE AND GENDER IN AWARD-WINNING CHILDREN'S BOOKS FROM THE LAST CENTURY, AND (2) WE EXAMINE HOW CONSUMPTION OF THESE BOOKS RELATES TO LOCAL BELIEFS. FIRST, WE ANALYZE THE SENTIMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAMOUS INDIVIDUALS MENTIONED IN THESE BOOKS. WHILE THE SENTIMENT SURROUNDING WOMEN IS POSITIVE OVERALL, ON AVERAGE, WE SEE THAT BLACK WOMEN ARE MORE OFTEN PORTRAYED WITH NEGATIVE SENTIMENT IN MAINSTREAM BOOKS, WHILE WHITE WOMEN ARE MORE OFTEN PORTRAYED WITH POSITIVE SENTIMENT. BECAUSE CHILDREN'S BOOKS IN THE US DEPICT MORE WHITE WOMEN OVERALL, THIS DISGUISES THE MORE NEGATIVE INTERSECTIONAL PORTRAYALS OF BLACK WOMEN. BOOKS THAT CENTER UNDERREPRESENTED IDENTITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO PORTRAY ALL CHARACTERS WITH MORE POSITIVE SENTIMENT. A CENTURY AGO, WOMEN WERE MUCH LESS POSITIVELY SPOKEN ABOUT THAN MEN, BUT THE AVERAGE SENTIMENT OF FEMALES AND MALES HAS CONVERGED OVER TIME. THE DIFFERENCE IN SENTIMENT CONNECTED WITH BLACK PEOPLE AND WHITE PEOPLE HAS ALSO DECREASED OVER TIME, BUT THERE STILL REMAINS A SUBSTANTIAL GAP. SECOND, WE THEN ANALYZE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOOK PURCHASES AND LOCAL BELIEFS TO UNDERSTAND THE POTENTIAL MESSAGES BEING TRANSMITTED TO CHILDREN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF SOCIETY. WE SEE THAT MORE PURCHASES OF BOOKS WITH POSITIVE SENTIMENT TOWARDS BLACK CHARACTERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A LARGER PROPORTION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO BELIEVE THAT WHITE PEOPLE IN THE U.S. HAVE CERTAIN ADVANTAGES BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN AND WHO ARE ANGRY THAT RACISM EXISTS. UNDERSTANDING THE MESSAGES THAT MAY BE IMPLICITLY -- OR EXPLICITLY -- SENT TO CHILDREN THROUGH HIGHLY INFLUENTIAL BOOKS CAN LEND INSIGHT INTO THE FACTORS THAT MAY SHAPE CHILDREN'S BELIEFS AND ATTITUDES.   [VIDEO] ""MEASURING REPRESENTATION OF RACE, GENDER, AND AGE IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS: FACE DETECTION AND FEATURE CLASSIFICATION IN ILLUSTRATED IMAGES"" (WITH T. SZASZ, E. HARRISON, P-J. LIU, P-C. LIN, H.B. RUNESHA) (JANUARY 2022, PROCEEDINGS OF THE IEEE/CVF WINTER CONFERENCE ON APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTER VISION (WACV))
IMAGES IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS CONVEY MESSAGES ABOUT SOCIETY AND THE ROLES THAT PEOPLE PLAY IN IT. UNDERSTANDING THESE MESSAGES REQUIRES SYSTEMATIC MEASUREMENT OF WHO IS REPRESENTED. COMPUTER VISION FACE DETECTION TOOLS CAN PROVIDE SUCH MEASUREMENTS; HOWEVER, STATE-OF-THE-ART FACE DETECTION MODELS WERE TRAINED WITH PHOTOGRAPHS, AND 80\% OF IMAGES IN CHILDREN'S BOOKS ARE ILLUSTRATED; THUS EXISTING METHODS BOTH MISCLASSIFY AND MISS CLASSIFYING MANY FACES. IN THIS PAPER, WE INTRODUCE A NEW APPROACH TO ANALYZE IMAGES USING AI TOOLS, RESULTING IN DATA THAT CAN ASSESS REPRESENTATION OF RACE, GENDER, AND AGE IN BOTH ILLUSTRATIONS AND PHOTOGRAPHS IN CHILDREN’S BOOKS. WE MAKE FOUR PRIMARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE FIELDS OF DEEP LEARNING AND SOCIAL SCIENCES: (1) WE CURATE AN ORIGINAL FACE DETECTION DATA SET (ILLUSFACE 1.0) BY MANUALLY LABELING 5,403 ILLUSTRATED FACES WITH BOUNDING BOXES. (2) WE TRAIN TWO AUTOML-BASED FACE DETECTION MODELS FOR ILLUSTRATIONS: (I) USING ILLUSFACE 1.0 (FDAI); (II) USING ICARTOON, A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA SET (FDAI_IC), EACH OPTIMIZED FOR ILLUSTRATED IMAGES, DETECTING 2.5 TIMES MORE FACES IN OUR TESTING DATA THAN THE ESTABLISHED FACE DETECTOR USING GOOGLE VISION (FDGV). (3) WE CURATE A DATA SET OF THE RACE, GENDER, AND AGE OF 980 FACES MANUALLY LABELED BY THREE DIFFERENT RATERS (CBFEATURES 1.0). (4) WE TRAIN AN AUTOML FEATURE CLASSIFICATION MODEL (FCA) USING CBFEATURES 1.0. WE COMPARE FCA WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF ANOTHER AUTOML MODEL THAT WE TRAINED ON UTKFACE, A PUBLIC DATA SET (FCA_UTK) AND OF AN ESTABLISHED MODEL USING FAIRFACE (FCF). FINALLY, WE EXAMINE DISTRIBUTIONS OF CHARACTER IDENTITIES OVER THE LAST CENTURY ACROSS THE MODELS. WE FIND THAT FCA IS 34% MORE ACCURATE THAN FCF IN ITS RACE PREDICTIONS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDE TOOLS TO EDUCATORS, CAREGIVERS, AND CURRICULUM DEVELOPERS TO ASSESS THE REPRESENTATION CONTAINED IN CHILDREN'S CONTENT.    [POSTER]    [VIDEO] ""SANITATION AND EDUCATION"" (APRIL 2017, AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS)
I EXPLORE WHETHER THE ABSENCE OF SCHOOL-SANITATION INFRASTRUCTURE IMPEDES EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, PARTICULARLY AMONG PUBESCENT-AGE GIRLS, USING A NATIONAL INDIAN SCHOOL LATRINE-CONSTRUCTION INITIATIVE AND ADMINISTRATIVE SCHOOL-LEVEL DATA. SCHOOL-LATRINE CONSTRUCTION SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASES ENROLLMENT OF PUBESCENT-AGE GIRLS, THOUGH PREDOMINATELY WHEN PROVIDING SEX-SPECIFIC LATRINES. PRIVACY AND SAFETY APPEAR TO MATTER SUFFICIENTLY FOR PUBESCENT-AGE GIRLS THAT ONLY SEX-SPECIFIC LATRINES REDUCE GENDER DISPARITIES. ANY LATRINE SUBSTANTIALLY BENEFITS YOUNGER GIRLS AND BOYS, WHO MAY BE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO SICKNESS FROM UNCONTAINED WASTE. ACADEMIC TEST SCORES DID NOT INCREASE FOLLOWING LATRINE CONSTRUCTION, HOWEVER. ESTIMATED INCREASES IN ENROLLMENT ARE SIMILAR ACROSS THE SUBSTANTIAL VARIATION IN INDIAN DISTRICT CHARACTERISTICS.   [SLIDES] ""EDUCATIONAL INVESTMENT RESPONSES TO ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY: EVIDENCE FROM INDIAN ROAD CONSTRUCTION""
(WITH S. ASHER AND P. NOVOSAD) (JANUARY 2020, AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: APPLIED ECONOMICS)
THE RURAL POOR IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, ONCE ECONOMICALLY ISOLATED, ARE INCREASINGLY BEING CONNECTED TO OUTSIDE MARKETS. WHETHER THESE NEW CONNECTIONS CROWD OUT OR ENCOURAGE EDUCATIONAL INVESTMENT IS A CENTRAL QUESTION. WE EXAMINE THE IMPACTS ON EDUCATIONAL CHOICES OF 115,000 NEW ROADS BUILT UNDER INDIA'S FLAGSHIP ROAD CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM. WE FIND THAT CHILDREN STAY IN SCHOOL LONGER AND PERFORM BETTER ON STANDARDIZED EXAMS. TREATMENT HETEROGENEITY SUPPORTS THE PREDICTIONS OF A STANDARD HUMAN CAPITAL INVESTMENT MODEL: ENROLLMENT INCREASES ARE LARGEST WHERE NEARBY LABOR MARKETS OFFER THE HIGHEST RETURNS TO EDUCATION AND LOWEST WHERE THEY IMPLY HIGH OPPORTUNITY COSTS OF SCHOOLING.   [SLIDES] ""SPILLOVER IMPACTS ON EDUCATION FROM EMPLOYMENT GUARANTEES"" (JANUARY 2022, EDUCATION FINANCE AND POLICY)
PROGRAMS THAT GUARANTEE SOME BASIC LEVEL OF LOW-SKILL EMPLOYMENT ARE A POPULAR ANTI-POVERTY STRATEGY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, WITH INDIA'S EMPLOYMENT-GUARANTEE PROGRAM (MGNREGA) ANNUALLY EMPLOYING ADULTS IN 23% OF INDIAN HOUSEHOLDS.  AN IMPORTANT CONCERN IS THESE EMPLOYMENT PROGRAMS MAY DISCOURAGE CHILDREN'S EDUCATION AND, THUS, MORE-SUSTAINED LONG-RUN INCOME GROWTH.  USING LARGE-SCALE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AND HOUSEHOLD SURVEY DATA, I ESTIMATE PRECISE SPILLOVER IMPACTS ON EDUCATION THAT REJECT SUBSTANTIVE DECLINES IN CHILDREN'S EDUCATION FROM THE ROLLOUT OF MGNREGA.  THESE NEGATIVE SPILLOVERS ARE INEXPENSIVE TO COUNTERACT, AND SMALL COMPARED TO IMMEDIATE EFFECTS OF MGNREGA ON RURAL EMPLOYMENT AND POVERTY ALLEVIATION.  [TAKEAWAY (ONE-PAGER)] ""RELIGION AND SANITATION PRACTICES""
(WITH M. ALSAN, K. BABIARZ, J. GOLDHABER-FIEBERT, AND L. PRINCE)  (MAY 2021, WORLD BANK ECONOMIC REVIEW)
IN INDIA, INFANT MORTALITY AMONG HINDUS IS HIGHER THAN AMONG MUSLIMS, AND RELIGIOUS DIFFERENCES IN SANITATION PRACTICES HAVE BEEN CITED AS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. TO EXPLORE WHETHER RELIGION ITSELF IS ASSOCIATED WITH DIFFERENCES IN SANITATION PRACTICES, THIS STUDY COMPARES SANITATION PRACTICES OF HINDUS AND MUSLIMS LIVING IN THE SAME LOCATIONS USING THREE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA SETS FROM INDIA. ACROSS ALL THREE DATA SETS, THE UNCONDITIONAL RELIGION-SPECIFIC GAP IN LATRINE OWNERSHIP AND LATRINE USE DECLINES BY APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS WHEN CONDITIONING ON LOCATION CHARACTERISTICS OR INCLUDING LOCATION FIXED EFFECTS. FURTHER, THE ESTIMATES DO NOT SHOW EVIDENCE OF RELIGION-SPECIFIC DIFFERENCES IN OTHER SANITATION PRACTICES, SUCH AS HANDWASHING OR OBSERVED FECAL MATERIAL NEAR HOMES. HOUSEHOLD SANITATION PRACTICES VARY SUBSTANTIALLY ACROSS AREAS OF INDIA, BUT RELIGION ITSELF HAS LESS DIRECT INFLUENCE WHEN CONSIDERING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN HINDUS AND MUSLIMS WITHIN THE SAME LOCATION.

THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT OF NATIONS RELIES ON THEIR POPULATION HAVING PHYSICAL ACCESS TO SERVICES AND EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES. FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE 3.4 BILLION PEOPLE LIVING IN RURAL LOCATIONS, THIS LARGELY DEPENDS ON THEIR ACCESS TO URBAN CENTERS OF DIFFERENT SIZES. SIMILARLY, URBAN CENTERS DEPEND ON THEIR RURAL HINTERLANDS. BUILDING ON THE LITERATURE ON FUNCTIONAL AREAS/TERRITORIES AND THE RURAL-URBAN CONTINUUM AS WELL AS INSIGHTS FROM CENTRAL PLACE THEORY, THIS REVIEW PAPER ADVANCES THE NOTION OF CATCHMENT AREAS DIFFERENTIATED ALONG AN URBAN-TO-RURAL CONTINUUM TO CAPTURE THESE URBAN-RURAL INTERCONNECTIONS. IT FURTHER SHOWS HOW A NEW, PUBLICLY AVAILABLE DATA SET OPERATIONALIZING THIS CONCEPT CAN SHED NEW LIGHT ON POLICY MAKING ACROSS A SERIES OF DEVELOPMENT FIELDS, INCLUDING INSTITUTIONS AND GOVERNANCE, URBANIZATION AND FOOD SYSTEMS, WELFARE AND POVERTY, AND ACCESS TO HEALTH AND EDUCATION SERVICES. TOGETHER THE INSIGHTS SUPPORT A MORE GEOGRAPHICALLY NUANCED PERSPECTIVE ON DEVELOPMENT. [BLOG POST WITH D.K. EVANS: MOST OUT-OF-SCHOOL CHILDREN ARE IN RURAL AREAS.

					WORKING PAPER (NOVEMBER 2018)THE SYNTHETIC CONTROL METHOD (SCM) IS A POPULAR APPROACH FOR ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF A TREATMENT ON A SINGLE UNIT IN PANEL DATA SETTINGS. THE “SYNTHETIC CONTROL” IS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF CONTROL UNITS THAT BALANCES THE TREATED UNIT’S PRE-TREATMENT OUTCOMES AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE. THE CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY, HOWEVER, MEANS THAT SCM DOES NOT GENERALLY ACHIEVE EXACT BALANCE, WHICH CAN BIAS THE SCM ESTIMATE. WE PROPOSE AN EXTENSION, AUGMENTED SCM, WHICH USES AN OUTCOME MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE BIAS DUE TO COVARIATE IMBALANCE AND THEN DE-BIASES THE ORIGINAL SCM ESTIMATE, ANALOGOUS TO BIAS CORRECTION FOR INEXACT MATCHING. WE MOTIVATE THIS APPROACH BY SHOWING THAT SCM IS A (REGULARIZED) INVERSE PROPENSITY SCORE WEIGHTING ESTIMATOR, WITH PRE-TREATMENT OUTCOMES AS COVARIATES AND A RIDGE PENALTY ON THE PROPENSITY SCORE COEFFICIENTS. WE GIVE THEORETICAL GUARANTEES FOR SPECIFIC CASES AND PROPOSE A NEW INFERENCE PROCEDURE. WE DEMONSTRATE GAINS FROM AUGMENTED SCM WITH EXTENSIVE SIMULATION STUDIES AND APPLY THIS FRAMEWORK TO CANONICAL SCM EXAMPLES. WE IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED METHOD IN THE NEW AUGSYNTH R PACKAGE.DOWNLOAD

IN TWO STUDIES, WE SHOWED THAT EXPOSURE TO EXEMPLARY PEER PERFORMANCES CAN UNDERMINE MOTIVATION AND SUCCESS BY CAUSING PEOPLE TO PERCEIVE THAT THEY CANNOT ATTAIN THEIR PEERS’ HIGH LEVELS OF PERFORMANCE. IT ALSO CAUSES DE-IDENTIFICATION WITH THE RELEVANT DOMAIN. WE EXAMINED SUCH DISCOURAGEMENT BY PEER EXCELLENCE BY EXPLOITING THE INCIDENTAL EXPOSURE TO PEERS’ ABILITIES THAT OCCURS WHEN STUDENTS ARE ASKED TO ASSESS EACH OTHER’S WORK. STUDY 1 WAS A NATURAL EXPERIMENT IN A MASSIVE OPEN ONLINE COURSE THAT EMPLOYED PEER ASSESSMENT (N = 5,740). EXPOSURE TO EXEMPLARY PEER PERFORMANCES CAUSED A LARGE PROPORTION OF STUDENTS TO QUIT THE COURSE. STUDY 2 EXPLORED UNDERLYING PSYCHOLOGICAL MECHANISMS IN AN ONLINE REPLICATION (N = 361). DISCOURAGEMENT BY PEER EXCELLENCE HAS THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR WORK ON SOCIAL JUDGMENT, SOCIAL COMPARISON, AND REFERENCE BIAS AND HAS PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR INTERVENTIONS THAT INDUCE SOCIAL COMPARISONS.DOWNLOAD

IN THIS PAPER, WE ESTIMATE DIFFERENTIAL IMPACTS OF AN EARLY CHILDHOOD INTERVENTION BY ALTERNATIVE CARE SETTING, USING DATA FROM THE HEAD START IMPACT STUDY, A LARGE-SCALE RANDOMIZED EVALUATION. TO DO SO, WE UTILIZE A BAYESIAN PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE SEPARATE IMPACTS FOR TWO TYPES OF COMPLIERS: THOSE CHILDREN WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN OTHER CENTER-BASED CARE WHEN ASSIGNED TO CONTROL AND THOSE WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN HOME-BASED CARE. WE FIND STRONG, POSITIVE SHORT-TERM EFFECTS OF HEAD START ON RECEPTIVE VOCABULARY FOR THOSE COMPLIERS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN HOME-BASED CARE. BY CONTRAST, WE FIND NO MEANINGFUL IMPACT OF HEAD START ON VOCABULARY FOR THOSE COMPLIERS WHO WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN OTHER CENTER-BASED CARE. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT ALTERNATIVE CARE TYPE IS A POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF VARIATION IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION INTERVENTIONS. DOWNLOAD

(WITH P. DING AND L. MIRATRIX)APPLIED RESEARCHERS ARE INCREASINGLY INTERESTED IN WHETHER AND HOW TREATMENT EFFECTS VARY IN RANDOMIZED EVALUATIONS, ESPECIALLY VARIATION THAT IS NOT EXPLAINED BY OBSERVED COVARIATES. WE PROPOSE A MODEL-FREE APPROACH FOR TESTING FOR THE PRESENCE OF SUCH UNEXPLAINED VARIATION. TO USE THIS RANDOMIZATION-BASED APPROACH, WE MUST ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THE AVERAGE TREATMENT EFFECT, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE OBJECT OF INTEREST IN RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENTS, ACTUALLY ACTS AS A NUISANCE PARAMETER IN THIS SETTING. WE EXPLORE POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS AND ADVOCATE FOR A METHOD THAT GUARANTEES VALID TESTS IN FINITE SAMPLES DESPITE THIS NUISANCE. WE ALSO SHOW HOW THIS METHOD READILY EXTENDS TO TESTING FOR HETEROGENEITY BEYOND A GIVEN MODEL, WHICH CAN BE USEFUL FOR AS- SESSING THE SUFFICIENCY OF A GIVEN SCIENTIFIC THEORY. WE FINALLY APPLY OUR METHOD TO THE NATIONAL HEAD START IMPACT STUDY, WHICH IS A LARGE-SCALE RANDOMIZED EVALUATION OF A FEDERAL PRESCHOOL PROGRAMME, FINDING THAT THERE IS INDEED SIGNIFICANT UNEXPLAINED TREATMENT EFFECT VARIATION. 2015. AMERICAN JOURNAL OF EVALUATION. (WITH L. PAGE, T. GRINDAL, L. MIRATRIX, AND M.-A. SOMERS) INCREASINGLY, RESEARCHERS ARE INTERESTED IN QUESTIONS REGARDING TREATMENT-EFFECT VARIATION ACROSS PARTIALLY OR FULLY LATENT SUBGROUPS DEFINED NOT BY PRETREATMENT CHARACTERISTICS BUT BY POSTRANDOMIZATION ACTIONS. ONE PROMISING APPROACH TO ADDRESS SUCH QUESTIONS IS PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION. UNDER THIS FRAMEWORK, A RESEARCHER DEFINES ENDOGENOUS SUBGROUPS, OR PRINCIPAL STRATA, BASED ON POST-RANDOMIZATION BEHAVIORS UNDER BOTH THE OBSERVED AND THE COUNTERFACTUAL EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS. THESE PRINCIPAL STRATA GIVE STRUCTURE TO SUCH RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR DETERMINING ESTIMATION STRATEGIES TO OBTAIN DESIRED EFFECT ESTIMATES. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A NONTECHNICAL PRIMER TO PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION. WE REVIEW SELECTED APPLICATIONS TO HIGHLIGHT THE BREADTH OF SUBSTANTIVE QUESTIONS AND METHODOLOGICAL ISSUES THAT THIS METHOD CAN INFORM. WE THEN DISCUSS ITS RELATIONSHIP TO INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS BINARY NONCOMPLIANCE IN AN EXPERIMENTAL CONTEXT AND HIGHLIGHT HOW THE FRAMEWORK CAN BE GENERALIZED TO HANDLE MORE COMPLEX POSTTREATMENT PATTERNS. WE EMPHASIZE THE COUNTERFACTUAL LOGIC FUNDAMENTAL TO PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION AND THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS THAT RENDER ANALYTIC CHALLENGES MORE TRACTABLE.

THIS PARADIGM ALLOWS FOR ADVERSE SELECTION, WHICH COULD OCCUR IF PROJECT DEVELOPERS PREFERENTIALLY SELECT FORESTS THAT ARE ECOLOGICALLY DISTINCT FROM UNREPRESENTATIVE REGIONAL AVERAGES. BY DIGITIZING AND ANALYZING COMPREHENSIVE OFFSET PROJECT RECORDS ALONGSIDE DETAILED FOREST INVENTORY DATA, WE PROVIDE DIRECT EVIDENCE THAT COMPARING PROJECTS AGAINST COARSE REGIONAL CARBON AVERAGES HAS LED TO SYSTEMATIC OVER-CREDITING OF 30.0 MILLION TCO2E (90% CI: 20.5 TO 38.6 MILLION TCO2E) OR 29.4% OF THE CREDITS WE ANALYZED (90% CI: 20.1 TO 37.8%). THESE EXCESS CREDITS ARE WORTH AN ESTIMATED $410 MILLION (90% CI: $280 TO $528 MILLION) AT RECENT MARKET PRICES. RATHER THAN IMPROVE FOREST MANAGEMENT TO STORE ADDITIONAL CARBON, CALIFORNIA’S OFFSETS PROGRAM CREATES INCENTIVES TO GENERATE OFFSET CREDITS THAT DO NOT REFLECT REAL CLIMATE BENEFITS.DOWNLOAD

SIVAS, & MICHAEL WARA (2020) CLIMATE POLICY, DOI: 10.1080/14693062.2020.1781035CARBON OFFSETS ALLOW GREENHOUSE GAS EMITTERS TO COMPLY WITH AN EMISSIONS CAP BY PAYING OTHERS OUTSIDE OF THE CAPPED SECTORS TO REDUCE EMISSIONS. THE FIRST MAJOR CARBON OFFSET PROGRAMME, THE UNITED NATIONS’ CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM (CDM), HAS BEEN CRITICIZED FOR GENERATING A LARGE NUMBER OF CREDITS FROM PROJECTS THAT DO NOT ACTUALLY REDUCE EMISSIONS. FOLLOWING THE CONTROVERSIAL CDM EXPERIENCE, CALIFORNIA PIONEERED A SECOND-GENERATION COMPLIANCE OFFSET PROGRAMME THAT SHIFTS THE FOCUS OF QUALITY CONTROL FROM ASSESSMENTS OF INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OFFSET PROTOCOLS, WHICH DEFINE PROJECT TYPE-SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND METHODS FOR ESTIMATING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. WE ASSESS THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA’S ‘STANDARDIZED APPROACH’ TO MITIGATE THE RISK OF OVER-CREDITING GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS BY REVIEWING THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO CALIFORNIA OFFSET PROTOCOLS – MINE METHANE CAPTURE AND RICE CULTIVATION. WE EXAMINE THE REGULATOR’S TREATMENT OF THREE SOURCES OF OVER-CREDITING UNDER THE CDM: NON-ADDITIONAL PROJECTS, INFLATED COUNTERFACTUAL BASELINE SCENARIOS, AND PERVERSE INCENTIVES THAT INADVERTENTLY INCREASE EMISSIONS. WE FIND THAT THE STANDARDIZED APPROACH OFFERS THE ABILITY TO REDUCE, BUT NOT ELIMINATE, THE RISK OF OVER-CREDITING. THIS REQUIRES CAREFUL PROTOCOL-SCALE ANALYSIS, CONSERVATIVE METHODS FOR ESTIMATING REDUCTIONS, ONGOING MONITORING OF PROGRAMME OUTCOMES, AND RESTRICTING PARTICIPATION TO PROJECT TYPES WITH MANAGEABLE LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY IN EMISSION REDUCTIONS. HOWEVER, SEVERAL OF THESE ELEMENTS ARE MISSING FROM CALIFORNIA’S REGIME, AND EVEN BEST PRACTICES RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN TRUE EMISSION REDUCTIONS. RELYING ON CARBON OFFSETS TO LOWER COMPLIANCE COSTS RISKS LESSENING TOTAL EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND INCREASES UNCERTAINTY IN WHETHER AN EMISSIONS TARGET HAS BEEN MET.KEY POLICY INSIGHTS- SUBSTANTIAL AND ONGOING OVERSIGHT BY OFFSET PROGRAMME ADMINISTRATORS IS NEEDED TO CONTAIN UNCERTAINTY AND AVOID OVER-CREDITING.- CALIFORNIA’S MINE METHANE CAPTURE PROTOCOL MAY HAVE INFLUENCED FEDERAL DECISIONS NOT TO REGULATE METHANE EMISSIONS FROM COAL MINES ON FEDERALLY-OWNED LANDS.- GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES AND METHODOLOGICAL CHOICES DRIVE OUTCOMES IN CARBON PRICING POLICIES WITH LARGE OFFSET PROGRAMMES, CONTRARY TO THE COMMON PERCEPTION THAT THESE POLICIES DELEGATE DECISION-MAKING TO PRIVATE ACTORS.- OFFSETS ARE BETTER UNDERSTOOD AS A WAY FOR REGULATED EMITTERS TO INVEST IN AN INCENTIVE PROGRAMME THAT ACHIEVES DIFFICULT-TO-ESTIMATE EMISSION REDUCTIONS, THAN AS ACCURATELY QUANTIFIED TONS OF REDUCTIONS.DOWNLOAD

WE FOCUS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CALIFORNIA'S GLOBAL WARMING LAW, BASED ON OUR PARTICIPATION IN THE PUBLIC PROCESS SURROUNDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO NEW CARBON OFFSET PROTOCOLS. MOST OF OUR WORK ON THE PROTOCOLS FOCUSED ON STRATEGIES FOR ENSURING THAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF THE PROGRAM REMAINS ROBUST IN THE FACE OF SIGNIFICANT SCIENTIFIC AND BEHAVIORAL UNCERTAINTY ABOUT PROTOCOL OUTCOMES. IN ADDITION TO RESPONDING TO TECHNICAL ISSUES RAISED BY GOVERNMENT STAFF, OUR CONTRIBUTIONS- ALONG WITH THOSE FROM OTHER OUTSIDE SCIENTISTS- HELPED EXPAND THE PROTOCOL DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSION TO INCLUDE IMPORTANT SCIENTIFIC ISSUES THAT WOULD NOT HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN PART OF THE PROCESS.

CLIMATE AND DEVELOPMENT 1:66-81. DOI:10.3763/CDEV.2009.0002THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT HAS SET THE CHALLENGING GOAL OF INCREASING ITS ELECTRICITY CAPACITY SIX- TO EIGHT-FOLD IN THE NEXT 30 YEARS IN THE CONTEXT OF SIGNIFICANT CAPACITY SHORTFALLS AND A FINANCIALLY AILING ELECTRICITY SECTOR. THE CENTRAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE SUBSIDIZING RENEWABLE ENERGY BECAUSE OF ENERGY SECURITY CONCERNS, TO PROMOTE DOMESTIC RESOURCES AND A DIVERSITY OF FUEL SUPPLY. INTERNATIONAL FUNDS MADE AVAILABLE THROUGH THE INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE REGIME COULD POTENTIALLY PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT TO PAY THE HIGHER COSTS THAT MOST RENEWABLE ENERGY REQUIRES. THIS ARTICLE PERFORMS A CASE STUDY ANALYSIS OF THE HISTORY OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF ONE RENEWABLE ENERGY TECHNOLOGY IN INDIA – COGENERATION OF SUGARCANE WASTE – FOCUSING ON THE BARRIERS THIS TECHNOLOGY HAS FACED IN THE PAST AND NOW FACES, AND HOW WELL INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC EFFORTS HAVE WORKED TO OVERCOME THESE BARRIERS. THE GOAL OF THIS WORK IS TO LEND INSIGHT INTO THE EFFECTIVE STRUCTURE OF FUTURE INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT MECHANISMS BEING DISCUSSED FOR INCLUSION UNDER THE POST-2012 CLIMATE CHANGE REGIME. THIS STUDY FINDS THAT BAGASSE COGENERATION HAS FACED LAYERS OF INFORMATIONAL, TECHNICAL, REGULATORY AND FINANCIAL BARRIERS THAT HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME, AND DIFFERED SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE PRIVATE AND COOPERATIVE SUGAR SECTORS. EACH OF THE PROGRAMMES DESIGNED TO SUPPORT BAGASSE COGENERATION HAD A ROLE TO PLAY IN ENABLING THE BAGASSE COGENERATION CURRENTLY INSTALLED, AND NO SINGLE PROGRAMME WOULD HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL ON ITS OWN. SOME BARRIERS TO THE TECHNOLOGY NEEDED DIRECTED EFFORTS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS THE SPECIFIC CONTEXT OF THE SUGAR SECTOR IN INDIA; SIMPLY SUBSIDIZING THE TECHNOLOGY OR PUTTING A PRICE ON CARBON WAS NOT ENOUGH. WHERE CLIMATE (GLOBAL) AND DEVELOPMENT (LOCAL) PRIORITIES DIFFER, PROJECTS THAT BRING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL GOALS RISK RUNNING INTO CONFLICT WITH OTHER MORE PRESSING DOMESTIC GOALS. INTERVIEWS AT MILLS ATTEMPTING TO ACCESS CARBON FINANCING THROUGH THE KYOTO PROTOCOL’S CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM (CDM) INDICATE THAT ADDITIONALITY-TESTING IS A CHALLENGE TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS MECHANISM. ANY EFFORT TO EXPLOIT THE REMAINING 86% OF THE ESTIMATED NATIONAL POTENTIAL FOR HIGH EFFICIENCY BAGASSE COGENERATION WILL NEED TO ADDRESS THE SPECIAL FINANCIAL AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS FACING COOPERATIVE MILLS.DOWNLOAD 
									PDF (294KB)HAYA, B. (2010). DOCTORAL DISSERTATION. ENERGY & RESOURCES GROUP, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BERKELEY.CARBON TRADING IS BEING IMPLEMENTED ON INTERNATIONAL, NATIONAL AND SUB-NATIONAL SCALES IN MOST PLACES WHERE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS TARGETS ARE ENACTED. THE APPEAL OF CARBON TRADING IS EFFICIENCY, LOWERING THE COST OF CLIMATE MITIGATION BY ALLOWING THE MARKET TO FIND THE LEAST EXPENSIVE SOURCES OF REDUCTION. IN THIS DISSERTATION I PROBE THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CARBON TRADING IS EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE THROUGH GROUNDED CASE STUDY.A MULTI-YEAR STUDY ON HOW THE KYOTO PROTOCOL’S CLEAN DEVELOPMENT MECHANISM (CDM) – THE WORLD’S LARGEST CARBON OFFSETTING PROGRAM – IS WORKING IN PRACTICE IN THE INDIAN POWER SECTOR (CHAPTER 2) DOCUMENTS LARGE UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EMISSIONS REDUCED BY THE PROGRAM. THIS UNCERTAINTY HAS RESULTED IN LARGE NUMBERS OF CDM PROJECTS THAT DO NOT ACTUALLY REDUCE EMISSIONS (ARE “NON-ADDITIONAL”) AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY THAT UNDERMINES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM IN SUPPORTING NEW PROJECTS. IN THE MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM, EVEN IF THE QUALITY OF OFFSETTING PROJECTS CAN BE ASSURED, THE PURPORTED EFFICIENCY OF OFFSETTING MUST BE WEIGHED AGAINST WAYS THAT OFFSETTING AT LARGE SCALE MAKES INTERNATIONAL CLIMATE CHANGE COOPERATION MORE DIFFICULT OVER THE NEXT DECADES.THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF INTEREST IN CONTINUING OFFSETTING BY ENSURING THAT THE CREDITS GENERATED REPRESENT REAL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. CHAPTER 3 EXAMINES THE PROSPECTS FOR DEVELOPING A MORE RIGOROUS “ADDITIONALITY TEST” FOR FILTERING OUT PROPOSED CDM PROJECTS THAT ARE BUSINESS-ASUSUAL AND THEREFORE DO NOT REPRESENT REAL EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS UNDER THE PROGRAM. THROUGH IN DEPTH CASE STUDIES OF ADDITIONALITY TESTING FOR WIND, BIOMASS AND HYDROPOWER PROJECTS IN INDIA, I CONCLUDE THAT AT TODAY’S CARBON PRICES THERE IS NO ACCURATE VERIFIABLE INDICATOR OF WHETHER CO2 REDUCTION PROJECTS WOULD BE BUILT WITHOUT THE CDM.CHAPTER 4 PROBES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CARBON CREDITING IN INCENTIVIZING EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS. A FOCUSED LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF SUPPORT FOR BAGASSE COGENERATION IN INDIA REVEALS THAT A RANGE OF SHIFTING BARRIERS HAVE IMPEDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS COST EFFECTIVE TECHNOLOGY. A CARBON PRICE ALONE WOULD NOT HAVE OVERCOME THE BARRIERS TO THIS TECHNOLOGY, AND PARALLEL SUPPORT EFFORTS WERE NEEDED TO SPUR THIS TECHNOLOGY.POST-2012 CLIMATE CHANGE AGREEMENTS AND LEGISLATION INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR REPLACING CDM ADDITIONALITY TESTING WITH STANDARDIZED PROJECT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND INDICATE A SHIFT AWAY FROM PROJECT-BASED OFFSETTING TOWARDS OFFSETTING ON A SECTORAL LEVEL AS WAYS TO RETAIN THE EFFICIENCY OF OFFSETTING, BUT AVOID THE CURRENT PROBLEMS WITH THE CDM. I EXAMINE THIS RANGE OF PROPOSALS FOR REFORMING OR REPLACING THE CDM WITH A STUDY OF THE DESIGN OF A SECTORAL CREDITING PROGRAMS IN THE CEMENT SECTOR IN SHANDONG PROVINCE IN CHINA. THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT FOR MOST 2 CONCEPTIONS OF SECTORAL CREDITING PROGRAMS, THE PROBLEMS WITH THE CDM DOCUMENTED IN CHAPTERS 2, 3 AND 4 RISK BEING EVEN WORSE WHEN OFFSETTING IS IMPLEMENTED ON A SECTORAL LEVEL.I CONCLUDE WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF HOW SOME OF THE INEFFICIENCIES OF OFFSETTING MAY FEATURE IN CARBON TRADING GENERALLY BY TRACING PARALLELS BETWEEN THE DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CDM AND CALIFORNIA’S LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. I END WITH A POLICY DISCUSSION OF THE POLITICAL SPACE WITHIN WHICH OFFSETTING IS BEING NEGOTIATED INTERNATIONALLY, AND WITHIN THE US, AND ALTERNATIVES TO THE CDM AND OFFSETTING THAT MIGHT FULFILL POLITICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS TOGETHER.DOWNLOAD

CLIMATIC CHANGE, 63:247-257LAND-USE ACTIVITIES THAT AFFECT THE GLOBAL BALANCE OF GREENHOUSE GASES HAVE BEEN A TOPIC OF INTENSE DISCUSSION DURING ONGOING CLIMATE CHANGE TREATY NEGOTIATIONS. POLICY MECHANISMS THAT REWARD COUNTRIES FOR IMPLEMENTING CLIMATICALLY BENEFICIAL LAND-USE PRACTICES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BONN AND MARRAKECH AGREEMENTS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF THE KYOTO PROTOCOL. HOWEVER SOME STILL FEAR THAT LAND-USE PROJECTS FOCUSED NARROWLY ON CARBON GAIN WILL RESULT IN SOCIOECONOMIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL HARM, AND THUS CONFLICT WITH THE EXPLICIT SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OBJECTIVES OF THE AGREEMENT. WE PROPOSE A POLICY TOOL, IN THE FORM OF A MULTI-ATTRIBUTE DECISION MATRIX, WHICH CAN BE USED TO EVALUATE POTENTIAL AND COMPLETED LAND-USE PROJECTS FOR THEIR CLIMATE, ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIOECONOMIC IMPACTS SIMULTANEOUSLY. PROJECT EVALUATION USING THIS TOOL MAKES TRADEOFFS EXPLICIT AND ALLOWS IDENTIFICATION OF PROJECTS WITH MULTIPLE CO-BENEFITS FOR PROMOTION AHEAD OF OTHERS. COMBINED WITH APPROPRIATE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION, ACCOUNTING, AND VERIFICATION POLICIES, A LAND-USE ACTIVITY DECISION MATRIX CAN HELP ENSURE THAT PROGRESSIVE LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES ARE AN EFFECTIVE PART OF THE SOLUTION TO GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE.DOWNLOAD

DOWNLOAD DOWNLOAD A PDF (97KB, UPDATED 09-30-2020)THE PASS-THROUGH OF MINIMUM WAGES INTO US RETAIL PRICES: EVIDENCE FROM SUPERMARKET SCANNER DATA (WITH TOBIAS RENKIN AND MICHAEL SIEGENTHALER), SEPTEMBER 2020, FORTHCOMING, REVIEW OF ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS.THIS PAPER ESTIMATES THE PASS-THROUGH OF MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES INTO THE PRICES OF US GROCERY AND DRUG STORES. WE USE HIGH-FREQUENCY SCANNER DATA AND LEVERAGE A LARGE NUMBER OF STATE-LEVEL INCREASES IN MINIMUM WAGES BETWEEN 2001 AND 2012. WE FIND THAT A 10% MINIMUM WAGE HIKE TRANSLATES INTO A 0.36% INCREASE IN THE PRICES OF GROCERY PRODUCTS. THIS MAGNITUDE IS CONSISTENT WITH A FULL PASS-THROUGH OF COST INCREASES INTO CONSUMER PRICES. WE SHOW THAT PRICE ADJUSTMENTS OCCUR MOSTLY IN THE THREE MONTHS FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF MINIMUM WAGE LEGISLATION RATHER THAN AFTER IMPLEMENTATION, SUGGESTING THAT PRICING OF GROCERIES IS FORWARD-LOOKING. THE RISE IN PRICES OCCURS MOSTLY THROUGH AN INCREASE IN THE FREQUENCY OF PRICE INCREASES. PRICES RISE TO THE SAME EXTENT FOR GOODS CONSUMED BY LOW-INCOME AND HIGH-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CONSUMERS RATHER THAN FIRMS BEAR THE COST OF MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES IN THE RETAIL SECTOR.DOWNLOAD

									APPENDIX (3MB)MINIMUM WAGES AND RACIAL INEQUALITY (WITH ELLORA DERENONCOURT), AUGUST 2020, FORTHCOMING, QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS.THE EARNINGS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE WORKERS FELL DRAMATICALLY IN THE UNITED STATES IN THE LATE 1960S AND EARLY 1970S. THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT THE EXTENSION OF THE MINIMUM WAGE PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN THIS DECLINE. THE 1966 FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT EXTENDED FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE COVERAGE TO AGRICULTURE, RESTAURANTS, NURSING HOMES, AND OTHER SERVICES WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY UNCOVERED AND WHERE NEARLY A THIRD OF BLACK WORKERS WERE EMPLOYED. WE DIGITIZE OVER 1,000 HOURLY WAGE DISTRIBUTIONS FROM BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS INDUSTRY WAGE REPORTS AND USE CPS MICRO-DATA TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF THIS REFORM ON WAGES, EMPLOYMENT, AND RACIAL INEQUALITY. USING A CROSS-INDUSTRY DIFFERENCE- IN-DIFFERENCES DESIGN, WE SHOW THAT WAGES ROSE SHARPLY FOR WORKERS IN THE NEWLY COVERED INDUSTRIES. THE IMPACT WAS NEARLY TWICE AS LARGE FOR BLACK WORKERS AS FOR WHITE. WITHIN TREATED INDUSTRIES, THE RACIAL GAP ADJUSTED FOR OBSERVABLES FELL FROM 25 LOG POINTS PRE- REFORM TO ZERO AFTERWARDS. USING A BUNCHING DESIGN, WE FIND NO EFFECT OF THE REFORM ON EMPLOYMENT. WE CAN RULE OUT SIGNIFICANT DIS-EMPLOYMENT EFFECTS FOR BLACK WORKERS. THE 1966 EXTENSION OF THE MINIMUM WAGE CAN EXPLAIN MORE THAN 20% OF THE REDUCTION IN THE RACIAL EARNINGS AND INCOME GAP DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA. OUR FINDINGS SHED NEW LIGHT ON THE DYNAMICS OF LABOR MARKET INEQUALITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND SUGGEST THAT MINIMUM WAGE POLICY CAN PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN REDUCING RACIAL ECONOMIC DISPARITIES.DOWNLOAD

	ISLAND REGIONS AND ISOLATED COMMUNITIES REPRESENT AN UNDERSTUDIED AREA OF NOT ONLY CLEAN ENERGY DEVELOPMENT BUT ALSO OF INNOVATION. CARIBBEAN STATES HAVE FOR SOME TIME SHOWN INTEREST IN DEVELOPING A REGIONAL SUSTAINABLE ENERGY POLICY AND IN IMPLEMENTING MEASURES WHICH COULD HELP TO PROTECT ITS MEMBER STATES FROM VOLATILE OIL MARKETS WHILE PROMOTING RELIANCE ON LOCAL RESOURCES. HERE WE EXAMINE FOUR CASE STUDIES OF RENEWABLE ENERGY ADVANCEMENTS BEING MADE BY PUBLIC UTILITY COMPANIES AND INDEPENDENT ENERGY COMPANIES IN THE CARIBBEAN. WE ATTEMPT TO LOCATE RENEWABLE ENERGY ADVANCES IN A BROADER HISTORICAL FRAMEWORK OF ENERGY SECTOR DEVELOPMENT, INDICATING A FEW POLICY LESSONS. WE FIND THAT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE SOPHISTICATION HAVE EVOLVED IN DIFFERENT ISLANDS. ISLANDS SHOULD HAVE SPECIALIZED POLICY FOCUS, CONTRASTING THE AD-HOC NATURE OF CURRENT REGIONAL ENERGY POLICY DISCUSSION. WE ALSO CONDUCT A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS WHICH SHOWS THAT THESE EARLY, INNOVATIVE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY PROJECTS SHOW THEMSELVES TO BE BOTH PROFITABLE AND SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF EMISSIONS REDUCTION AND JOB CREATION. THIS LENDS SUPPORT TO THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF REGIONAL ENERGY POLICY.DOWNLOAD

	WE FIND THAT PLUG-IN HYBRID ELECTRIC VEHICLES (PHEVS) COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE AUTOMOTIVE GREENHOUSE GAS (GHG) EMISSIONS AND PETROLEUM CONSUMPTION, WHILE IMPROVING ENERGY SECURITY AND URBAN AIR QUALITY. WIDESPREAD PHEV ADOPTION WILL DEPEND UPON TECHNOLOGICAL AND ECONOMIC ADVANCES IN BATTERIES BECAUSE THE INITIAL FUEL SAVINGS DO NOT RAPIDLY COMPENSATE CONSUMERS FOR THE CAPITAL COSTS OF BATTERIES TODAY. FOR PHEV PURCHASES TO BECOME ECONOMICAL TO CONSUMERS, BATTERY PRICES MUST DECLINE FROM $1,300 PER KILOWATT-HOUR (KWH) TO ABOUT OR BELOW $500/KWH, OR U.S. GASOLINE PRICES MUST REMAIN AT ABOUT $5 PER GALLON-OR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST INSTITUTE POLICY INNOVATIONS WITH EQUIVALENT EFFECTS, SUCH AS POLICIES TO LOWER BATTERY COST AND INCREASE BATTERY LIFETIMES (E.G. A BROAD AND SUSTAINED PROGRAM OF BATTERY RD&D), OR THOSE TO WIDEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GASOLINE AND ELECTRICITY PRICES (E.G. CHANGES IN ENERGY TAXES). HOWEVER, EVEN BEFORE PHEVS BECOME COST-EFFECTIVE CONSUMERS, THEIR PURCHASE CAN STILL BE HIGHLY VALUABLE TO SOCIETY IF THEIR SIGNIFICANT GHG REDUCTIONS CAN BE ACHIEVED COST-EFFECTIVELY (USING A BENCHMARK PRICE OF ABOUT $50/T-CO2-EQ). USING THE GREET MODEL, WE DETERMINE THAT IN ORDER FOR PHEVS' REDUCTIONS TO BECOME COST-EFFECTIVE, EITHER THEIR PURCHASE MUST APPROACH CURRENT UNSUBSIDIZED PRICES-REQUIRING THE SAME POLICY INNOVATIONS DESCRIBED ABOVE-OR VERY LOW-GHG ELECTRICITY MUST BE USED TO POWER THEM. THIS REQUIRES POLICIES TO DECREASE THE GHG INTENSITY OF ELECTRICITY, SUCH AS RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO STANDARDS, FEED-IN TARIFFS OR OTHER MEASURES. IMPORTANTLY, WE FIND THAT ANY CARBON PRICE WOULD HAVE TO EXCEED $100/T-CO2-EQ IN ORDER TO RENDER PHEVS' REDUCTIONS COST-EFFECTIVE, AND HENCE A CARBON PRICE ALONE REPRESENTS AN IMPRACTICAL SHORT-TERM MEANS OF ACHIEVING THIS GOAL.DOWNLOAD

ADDITIONALITY AND LEAKAGE REQUIRE MORE RESEARCH. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR PROJECT SAMPLE, ON AVERAGE, IS OVER-CREDITED BY 6.3 TIMES. GOLD STANDARD’S METERED AND MEASURED METHODOLOGY, WHICH DIRECTLY MONITORS FUEL USE, IS MOST ALIGNED WITH OUR ESTIMATES (ONLY 1.3 TIMES OVER-CREDITED) AND IS BEST SUITED FOR FUEL SWITCHING PROJECTS WHICH PROVIDE THE MOST ABATEMENT POTENTIAL AND HEALTH BENEFIT.

									PDF SOLAR PHOTOVOLTAICS (PV) MANUFACTURING HAS EXPERIENCED DRAMATIC WORLDWIDE GROWTH IN RECENT YEARS, ENABLING A REDUCTION IN MODULE COSTS, AND A HIGHER ADOPTION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES. CONTINUED SUSTAINABLE PRICE REDUCTIONS, HOWEVER, REQUIRE STRATEGIES FOCUSED IN FURTHER TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, MINIMIZATION OF CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND OPTIMIZATION OF SUPPLY CHAIN FLOWS. WE PRESENT A FRAMEWORK: TECHNO-ECONOMIC INTEGRATED TOOL FOR TARIFF AND TRANSPORTATION (TIT-4-TAT), THAT ENABLES THE STUDY OF THESE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES BY COUPLING A TECHNO-ECONOMIC MODEL WITH A TARIFF AND TRANSPORTATION ALGORITHM TO OPTIMIZE SUPPLY CHAIN LAYOUTS FOR PV MANUFACTURING UNDER EQUALLY-WEIGHTED OBJECTIVES.WE DEMONSTRATE THE USE OF THIS FRAMEWORK IN A SET OF INTERACTING COUNTRIES (MEXICO, CHINA, USA, AND BRAZIL) AND TWO EXTREME TARIFF SCENARIOS: NO TARIFFS, AND HIGH TARIFF LEVELS IMPOSED. RESULTS INDICATE THAT INTRODUCING TARIFFS BETWEEN COUNTRIES SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE MINIMUM SUSTAINABLE PRICE FOR SOLAR PV MANUFACTURING, ALTER THE OPTIMAL MANUFACTURING LOCATIONS, AND RENDER A MORE EXPENSIVE FINAL SOLAR PV MODULE PRICE WHICH CAN HINDER THE ADOPTION RATES REQUIRED TO MITIGATE CLIMATE CHANGE. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STAKEHOLDERS ON THE OPTIMIZATION PROCESS, AND TECHNO-ECONOMIC DRIVERS ARE PRESENTED BASED ON OUR RESULTS. THIS FRAMEWORK MAY BE UTILIZED BY POLICYMAKERS FOR THE SPATIALLY-RESOLVED PLANNING OF INCENTIVES, LABOR AND MANUFACTURING PROGRAMS, AND PROPER IMPORT TARIFF DESIGNS IN THE SOLAR PV MARKET.DOWNLOAD 
									VIEW ARTICLE  DISTRIBUTED PHOTOVOLTAICS (PV) HAVE PLAYED A CRITICAL ROLE IN THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOLAR ENERGY, CURRENTLY MAKING UP ROUGHLY HALF OF THE GLOBAL PV INSTALLED CAPACITY. HOWEVER, THERE REMAINS SIGNIFICANT UNUSED ECONOMICALLY BENEFICIAL POTENTIAL. ESTIMATES OF THE TOTAL TECHNICAL POTENTIAL FOR ROOFTOP PV SYSTEMS IN THE UNITED STATES CALCULATE A GENERATION COMPARABLE TO APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE 2016 TOTAL NATIONAL ELECTRIC-SECTOR SALES. TO BEST TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE ROOFTOP PV POTENTIAL, EFFECTIVE ANALYTIC TOOLS THAT SUPPORT DEPLOYMENT STRATEGIES AND AGGRESSIVE LOCAL, STATE, AND NATIONAL POLICIES TO REDUCE THE SOFT COST OF SOLAR ENERGY ARE VITAL. A KEY STEP IS THE LOW-COST AUTOMATION OF DATA ANALYSIS AND BUSINESS CASE PRESENTATION FOR STRUCTURE-INTEGRATED SOLAR ENERGY. IN THIS PAPER, THE SCALABILITY AND RESOLUTION OF VARIOUS METHODS TO ASSESS THE URBAN ROOFTOP PV POTENTIAL ARE COMPARED, CONCLUDING WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK IN BRIDGING METHODOLOGIES TO BETTER ASSIST POLICY MAKERS.DOWNLOAD

WE FIND 22 GEOTHERMAL RESOURCE ADOPTION IS MORE SENSITIVE TO OPERATIONAL DEGRADATION THAN HIGH CAPITAL COSTS, WHICH SUGGESTS AN EMPHASIS ON 23 ONGOING MAINTENANCE SUBSIDIES RATHER THAN UPFRONT CAPITAL COST SUBSIDIES. WE ALSO FIND THAT A COST-EFFECTIVE AND VIABLE SUITE OF 24 SOLUTIONS INCLUDES AVAILABILITY OF STORAGE, DIESEL ENGINES, AND TRANSMISSION EXPANSION TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO ENABLE UP TO 50% OF 25 WIND POWER PENETRATION. IN AN ALREADY LOW-CARBON SYSTEM, TYPICAL EXTERNALITY PRICING FOR CO2 HAS LITTLE TO NO EFFECT ON TECHNOLOGY 26 CHOICE.

HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE MOST COMPETITIVE WIND AND SOLAR RESOURCES ARE SPATIALLY UNEVEN, INTERNATIONAL TRANSMISSION COULD ALLOW THE REGION AS A WHOLE TO BENEFIT FROM “NO-REGRETS” OR LOW-COST, LOW-IMPACT, AND HIGHLY ACCESSIBLE RESOURCES. INTERNATIONAL ENERGY TRADE ALSO LOWERS SYSTEM COSTS BY REDUCING THE NEED FOR CONVENTIONAL POWER PLANTS AND ALLOWS LOWER IMPACT, MORE ACCESSIBLE RENEWABLE ENERGY SITES TO BE COST COMPETITIVE.

IN THIS PAPER, WE PRESENT A METHODOLOGY TO EVALUATE THE EVOLUTION OF THE SUSTAINABILITY OF STAND-ALONE MICROGRIDS PROJECTS. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY CONSIDERS A COMPOSITE SUSTAINABILITY INDEX (CSI) THAT INCLUDES BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF THE OPERATION OF THE MICROGRID IN A GIVEN COMMUNITY. THE CSI IS CONSTRUCTED ALONG ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL, ECONOMIC AND TECHNICAL DIMENSIONS OF THE MICROGRID. THE SUB-INDEXES OF EACH DIMENSION ARE AGGREGATED INTO THE CSI VIA A SET OF ADAPTIVE WEIGHTING FACTORS, WHICH INDICATE THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE CORRESPONDING DIMENSION IN THE SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY AIMS TO BE A SUPPORT INSTRUMENT FOR POLICY MAKERS ESPECIALLY WHEN DEFINING SOUND CORRECTIVE MEASURES TO GUARANTEE THE SUSTAINABILITY OF SMALL, ISOLATED MICROGRID PROJECTS. TO VALIDATE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY, A MICROGRID INSTALLED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF CHILE (HUATACONDO) HAS BEEN USED AS A BENCHMARKING PROJECT.DOWNLOAD

IN THE LAST 40 YEARS, THE REGION’S PRIMARY ENERGY DEMAND HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED. IN A GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT OF INCREASINGLY VOLATILE FUEL PRICES, EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, AND CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS, THE CONTINUED INCREASE IN DEMAND PRESENTS CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES TO LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN. TO MANAGE THE NEXT PHASE OF DEVELOPMENT, THE REGION’S GOVERNMENTS WILL NEED TO DEVELOP NEW ENERGY SOURCES AND PAY MORE ATTENTION TO SUSTAINABILITY. BY SOME MEASURES, LATIN AMERICA IS ALREADY AHEAD OF THE GAME. THE REGION HAS A LOW CARBON FOOTPRINT DUE TO THE LARGE SHARE OF HYDROPOWER IN ITS ENERGY MIX. HYDROPOWER CAN’T BE EXPANDED INDEFINITELY, HOWEVER, AND PROPOSED MEGA-DAMS IN COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHILE AND BRAZIL HAVE GENERATED PROTESTS FROM INDIGENOUS AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS.

JARDINE, R. MERIDETH, M. BLACK, AND S. LEROY, 240–266. A REPORT BY THE SOUTHWEST CLIMATE ALLIANCE. WASHINGTON, DC: ISLAND PRESS.
	ENERGY IS IMPORTANT TO THE SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES, WHERE 12.7% OF THE NATION’S ENERGY IS PRODUCED (EXTRACTED OR GENERATED) AND 12.1% IS CONSUMED. THE REGION IS IN THE FAVORABLE POSITION OF HAVING LOW PER-CAPITA ENERGY CONSUMPTION (222 MILLION BTUS PER PERSON) RELATIVE TO THAT OF THE NATION AS A WHOLE (302 MILLION BTUS PER PERSON); NEVERTHELESS, DISRUPTION OF POWER HAS SIGNIFICANT ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS FOR THE REGION (E.G., LACOMMARE AND ETO 2004; NORTHWEST POWER AND CONSERVATION COUNCIL 2005). CLIMATE CHANGE ITSELF, AS WELL AS STRATEGIES AIMED AT MITIGATION AND ADAPTATION HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT THE PRODUCTION, DEMAND, AND DELIVERY OF ENERGY IN A NUMBER OF WAYS. 
	• DELIVERY OF ELECTRICITY MAY BECOME MORE VULNERABLE TO DISRUPTION DUE TO CLIMATEINDUCED EXTREME HEAT AND DROUGHT EVENTS AS A RESULT OF:
	     − INCREASED DEMAND FOR HOME AND COMMERCIAL COOLING,
	     − REDUCED THERMAL POWER PLANT EFFICIENCIES DUE TO HIGH TEMPERATURES,
	     − REDUCED TRANSMISSION LINE, SUBSTATION, AND TRANSFORMER CAPACITIES DUE TO ELEVATED TEMPERATURES,
	     − POTENTIAL LOSS OF HYDROPOWER PRODUCTION,
	     − THREATENED THERMOELECTRIC GENERATION DUE TO LIMITED WATER SUPPLY, AND
	     − THE THREAT OF WILDFIRE TO TRANSMISSION INFRASTRUCTURE.
	(MEDIUM-HIGH CONFIDENCE)
	• CLIMATE-RELATED POLICIES HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE ENERGY SECTOR. A SHIFT FROM THE TRADITIONAL FOSSIL FUEL ECONOMY TO ONE RICH IN RENEWABLES HAS SIGNIFICANT IMPLICATIONS FOR RELATED WATER USE, LAND USE, AIR QUALITY, NATIONAL SECURITY, AND THE ECONOMY. THE VULNERABILITY OF THE ENERGY SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHWEST TO CLIMATE CHANGE DEPENDS ON HOW THE ENERGY SYSTEM EVOLVES OVER THIS CENTURY.

	WE REPORT ON LIFE CYCLE ASSESSMENT (LCA) OF THE ECONOMICS, GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL AND WATER (BOTH FOR DESALINATION AND WATER USE IN OPERATION) FOR A DISTRIBUTED CONCENTRATING SOLAR COMBINED HEAT AND POWER (DCS-CHP) SYSTEM. DETAILED SIMULATION OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE ACROSS 1020 SITES IN THE US COMBINED WITH A SENSIBLE COST ALLOCATION SCHEME INFORMS THIS LCA. WE FORECAST A LEVELIZED COST OF $0.25 KWH-1ELECTRICITY AND $0.03 KWH-1THERMAL, FOR A SYSTEM WITH A LIFE CYCLE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL OF ~80 GCO2 EQ KWH-1OF ELECTRICITY AND ~10 GCO2 EQ KWH-1 THERMAL, SITED IN OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA. ON THE BASIS OF THE ECONOMICS SHOWN FOR AIR COOLING, AND THE FACT THAT ANY COMBINED HEAT AND POWER SYSTEM REDUCES THE NEED FOR COOLING WHILE AT THE SAME TIME BOOSTING THE OVERALL SOLAR EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEM, DCS-CHP COMPARES FAVORABLY TO OTHER ELECTRIC POWER GENERATION SYSTEMS IN TERMS OF MINIMIZATION OF WATER USE IN THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATION OF THE PLANT.
	THE OUTLOOK FOR WATER DESALINATION COUPLED WITH DISTRIBUTED CONCENTRATING SOLAR COMBINED HEAT AND POWER IS LESS FAVORABLE. AT A PROJECTED COST OF $1.40 M-3, WATER DESALINATION WITH
	DCS-CHP WOULD BE ECONOMICAL AND PRACTICAL ONLY IN AREAS WHERE WATER IS VERY SCARCE OR MODERATELY EXPENSIVE, PRIMARILY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE INFORMAL SECTOR, AND WHERE CONTAMINATED OR SALT WATER IS EASILY AVAILABLE AS FEED-WATER. IT IS ALSO INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT $0.40–$1.90 M-3 IS THE RANGE OF WATER PRICES IN THE DEVELOPED WORLD, SO DCS-CHP
	DESALINATION SYSTEMS COULD ALSO BE AN ECONOMICAL SOLUTION THERE UNDER SOME CONDITIONS.DOWNLOAD

	MANY TOOLS THAT ARE HELPFUL FOR EVALUATING EMISSIONS MITIGATION MEASURES, SUCH AS CARBON ABATEMENT COST CURVES, FOCUS EXCLUSIVELY ON COST AND EMISSIONS REDUCTION POTENTIAL WITHOUT QUANTIFYING THE DIRECT AND INDIRECT IMPACTS ON STAKEHOLDERS. THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL BE THE MOST SEVERE AND IMMEDIATE FOR BILLIONS OF POOR PEOPLE, ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHOSE LIVELIHOODS ARE BASED ON AGRICULTURE AND SUBSISTENCE ACTIVITIES AND ARE DIRECTLY DEPENDENT ON WEATHER PATTERNS. THUS, EQUITY AND VULNERABILITY CONSIDERATIONS MUST BE CENTRAL TO GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTION STRATEGIES. A CASE STUDY OF A CARBON ABATEMENT COST CURVE FOR AN ELECTRICITY SYSTEM IN TWO NICARAGUAN RURAL VILLAGES IS PRESENTED AND IS COMPLEMENTED WITH ASSESSMENTS BASED ON THE POVERTY METRICS OF THE POVERTY HEADCOUNT, THE GINI COEFFICIENT, AND THE KUZNETS RATIOS.

THEY ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY WITH AN INDICATION OF THE OVERALL SCALE OF THE EFFORT REQUIRED E ONE ASPECT OF THE MANY INPUTS REQUIRED. WE FIND THAT MOST EXISTING PROJECTIONS, USING TYPICAL LONG-TERM FORECASTING METHODS FOR POWER PLANNING, SHOW ROUGHLY A THREEFOLD INCREASE IN INSTALLED GENERATION CAPACITY OCCURRING BY 2030, BUT MORE THAN A TENFOLD INCREASE WOULD LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE FOR FULL ACCESS E EVEN AT RELATIVELY MODEST LEVELS OF ELECTRICITY CONSUMPTION.

THE LARGE REDUCTIONS IN INVESTMENT BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR SHOULD BE A PARTICULAR AREA OF CONCERN FOR POLICY MAKERS. MULTIPLE MEASURES OF PATENTING ACTIVITY REVEAL WIDESPREAD DECLINES IN INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY THAT ARE CORRELATED WITH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) INVESTMENT—NOTABLY IN THE ENVIRONMENTALLY SIGNIFICANT WIND AND SOLAR AREAS. TRENDS IN VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND FUEL CELL INNOVATION ARE TWO PROMISING CASES THAT RUN COUNTER TO THE OVERALL TRENDS IN THE SECTOR. WE DRAW ON PRIOR WORK ON THE OPTIMAL LEVEL OF ENERGY R&D TO IDENTIFY A RANGE OF VALUES WHICH WOULD BE ADEQUATE TO ADDRESS ENERGY-RELATED CONCERNS. COMPARING SIMPLE SCENARIOS BASED ON THIS RANGE TO PAST PUBLIC R&D PROGRAMS AND INDUSTRY INVESTMENT DATA INDICATES THAT A FIVE TO TEN-FOLD INCREASE IN ENERGY R&D INVESTMENT IS BOTH WARRANTED AND FEASIBLE.DOWNLOAD

	AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOYS HAVE LONG FARED WORSE IN SCHOOL. THIS PAPER DOCUMENTS THIS ACHIEVEMENT GAP, THEN ASSESSES A NUMBER OF EVIDENCE-BASED STRATEGIES THAT HOLD PROMISE OF BRIDGING THAT GAP. THOSE STRATEGIES RANGE FROM HIGH-QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION AND SKILL-BUILDING READING PROGRAMS TO MENTORING INITIATIVES AND INTERVENTIONS THAT ADDRESS STEREOTYPE VULNERABILITY. MUCH OF THE EXISTING RESEARCH HAS NOT ISOLATED THE EFFECTS ON BLACK MALES, AND THE PAPER OFFERS NEW DATA THAT DEMONSTRATES THOSE IMPACTS. A SEQUENCE OF INTERVENTIONS, WHICH BEGIN BEFORE KINDERGARTEN AND CONTINUE DURING COLLEGE, IS RECOMMENDED.DOWNLOAD

	BY DAVID L. KIRP. 2013, OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS.
	NO SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN BE ALL CHARISMATIC LEADERS AND SUPER-TEACHERS. IT CAN'T START FROM SCRATCH, AND IT CAN'T FIRE ALL ITS TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS WHEN STUDENTS DO POORLY. GREAT CHARTER SCHOOLS CAN ONLY SERVE A TINY MINORITY OF STUDENTS. WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT, MOST OF OUR YOUNGSTERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE EDUCATED IN MAINSTREAM PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
	THE GOOD NEWS, AS DAVID L. KIRP REVEALS IN IMPROBABLE SCHOLARS, IS THAT THERE'S A SENSIBLE WAY TO REBUILD PUBLIC EDUCATION AND CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP FOR ALL STUDENTS. INDEED, THIS IS PRECISELY WHAT'S HAPPENING IN A MOST UNLIKELY PLACE: UNION CITY, NEW JERSEY, A POOR, CROWDED LATINO COMMUNITY JUST ACROSS THE HUDSON FROM MANHATTAN. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT--ONCE ONE OF THE WORST IN THE STATE--HAS IGNORED TRENDY REFORMS IN FAVOR OF PROVEN GAME-CHANGERS LIKE QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION, A WORD-SOAKED CURRICULUM, AND HANDS-ON HELP FOR TEACHERS. WHEN BENEFICIAL NEW STRATEGIES HAVE EMERGED, LIKE USING SOPHISTICATED DATA-CRUNCHING TO GENERATE PINPOINT ASSESSMENTS TO HELP INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS, THEY HAVE BEEN FOLDED INTO THE MIX.
	THE RESULTS DEMAND THAT WE TAKE NOTICE--FROM THIRD GRADE THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, UNION CITY SCORES ON THE HIGH-STAKES STATE TESTS APPROXIMATE THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE. IN OTHER WORDS, THESE INNER-CITY KIDS ARE ACHIEVING JUST AS MUCH AS THEIR SUBURBAN COUSINS IN READING, WRITING, AND MATH. WHAT'S EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVE, NEARLY NINETY PERCENT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS ARE EARNING THEIR DIPLOMAS AND SIXTY PERCENT OF THEM ARE GOING TO COLLEGE. TOP STUDENTS ARE WINNING NATIONAL SCIENCE AWARDS AND FULL RIDES AT IVY LEAGUE UNIVERSITIES. THESE SCHOOLS ARE NOT JUST GOOD PLACES FOR POOR KIDS. THEY ARE GOOD PLACES FOR KIDS, PERIOD.
	IMPROBABLE SCHOLARS OFFERS A PLAYBOOK--NOT A PRAYER BOOK--FOR REFORM THAT WILL DRAMATICALLY CHANGE OUR APPROACH TO REVIVING PUBLIC EDUCATION.

""ABUNDANT, AFFORDABLE OFFSHORE WIND CAN ACCELERATE OUR CLEAN ELECTRICITY FUTURE"" AUGUST 1, 2023. PLUMMETING COSTS AND TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS OF OFFSHORE WIND HAVE DRAMATICALLY ENHANCED THE PROSPECTS FOR NEAR-TERM POWER SECTOR DECARBONIZATION. THE HIGH RESOURCE QUALITY OF OFFSHORE WIND IN THE UNITED STATES, COUPLED WITH RAPIDLY FALLING TECHNOLOGY COSTS, MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR OFFSHORE WIND TO PROVIDE 10-25% OF TOTAL ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN THE U.S. POWER SYSTEM IN 2050 WITHOUT SUBSTANTIALLY IMPACTING WHOLESALE ELECTRICITY COSTS. THIS REPORT, 2035 REPORT 3.0, EXAMINES THE PROSPECT OF ACHIEVING 90% CLEAN ELECTRICITY BY 2035 AND 95% CLEAN ELECTRICITY BY 2050. THREE SCENARIOS — LOW, MEDIUM, AND HIGH AMBITION — DETAIL THE ELECTRICITY SYSTEM IMPACTS OF INCREASED OFFSHORE WIND GROWTH PROVIDING 10-25% OF TOTAL GENERATION.GLOBAL CARBON EMISSIONS MUST BE HALVED BY 2030 TO LIMIT GLOBAL WARMING TO 1.5 DEGREES CELSIUS AND AVOID THE MOST CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE (UN IPCC, 2023). WHILE THE UNITED STATES CONTINUES TO MAKE PROGRESS ON NATIONAL DECARBONIZATION TRENDS, WITH INCREASES IN CLEAN ENERGY PRODUC- TION DELIVERING CUTS IN POWER SECTOR EMISSIONS, 2022 STILL SAW A SLIGHT RISE IN THE NATION’S OVERALL GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS (RHODIUM GROUP, 2023). FOR THE U.S. TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS, IN WHICH THE NATION EMITS NO MORE CARBON INTO THE ATMOSPHERE THAN CAN BE REMOVED, THE U.S. MUST SIGNIFICANT- LY RAMP UP CLEAN ENERGY PRODUCTION WHILE ELECTRIFYING OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, SUCH AS BUILDINGS, TRANSPORTATION, AND INDUSTRY — LIKELY CAUSING U.S. ELECTRICITY DEMAND TO TRIPLE BY 2050. AROUND THE GLOBE, NATIONS HAVE BEGUN TO GRASP THE OPPORTUNITY ON THE WATERS. THE GLOBAL PIPELINE OF OFFSHORE WIND PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ANNOUNCED OR ARE IN PRE-CONSTRUCTION PHASES NOW STANDS AT OVER 700 GW (GEM, 2023). THE EUROPEAN UNION WILL ENDEAVOR TO BUILD NEARLY 400 GW OF OFFSHORE WIND BY 2050, WHILE CHINA INSTALLED 20 GW IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE (EUROPEAN COMMISSION, 2023; GWEC, 2023). WHILE THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS A TARGET TO DEPLOY 30 GW OF OFFSHORE WIND BY 2030 AND 110 GW BY 2050, INCREASING OFFSHORE WIND AMBITION BEYOND THESE CURRENT GOALS COULD ACCELERATE THE NATION’S TRANSITION TO NET ZERO EMISSIONS.DOWNLOAD

	POLITICS, ECONOMICS, AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE CONSPIRED TO MAKE THIS AN EXCEPTIONALLY CHALLENGING TIME FOR AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION. SOME CRITICS CLAIM THAT COSTS ARE OUT OF CONTROL IN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE NONPROFIT HIGHER EDUCATION. THEY BELIEVE THESE INSTITUTIONS WILL SOON GO THE WAY OF THE RAILROADS AS FOR-PROFIT INSTITUTIONS DISPLACE THEM AND THE INTERNET REPLACES COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND CLASSROOMS. OTHER CRITICS BEMOAN THE PRIVATIZATION OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND THE INCREASING ROLE OF MARKET FORCES. STILL OTHERS THINK HIGHER EDUCATION HAS LOST ITS WAY AND FAILS TO FOCUS ON EDUCATING UNDERGRADUATES.

					WORKING PAPER (APRIL 2020)WE USE NOVEL, LARGE-SCALE DATA ON 43 MILLION AMERICANS FROM THE 2000 CENSUS AND THE 2001 TO 2013 AMERICAN COMMUNITIES SURVEY LINKED TO THE SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION’S NUMIDENT TO STUDY HOW A POLICY-DRIVEN INCREASE IN ECONOMIC RESOURCES FOR FAMILIES AFFECTS CHILDREN’S LONG-TERM OUTCOMES. USING VARIATION FROM THE COUNTY-LEVEL ROLL-OUT OF THE FOOD STAMPS PROGRAM BETWEEN 1961 AND 1975, WE FIND THAT CHILDREN WITH ACCESS TO GREATER ECONOMIC RESOURCES BEFORE AGE FIVE EXPERIENCE AN INCREASE OF 6 PERCENT OF A STANDARD DEVIATION IN THEIR ADULT HUMAN CAPITAL, 3 PERCENT OF A STANDARD DEVIATION IN THEIR ADULT ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY, 8 PERCENT OF A STANDARD DEVIATION IN THE QUALITY OF THEIR ADULT NEIGHBORHOODS, 0.4 PERCENTAGE-POINT INCREASE IN LONGEVITY, AND A 0.5 PERCENTAGE-POINT DECREASE IN LIKELIHOOD OF BEING INCARCERATED. BASED ON THESE ESTIMATES, WE CONCLUDE THAT FOOD STAMPS’ TRANSFER OF RESOURCES TO FAMILIES IS A HIGHLY COST-EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT INTO YOUNG CHILDREN, YIELDING A MARGINAL VALUE OF PUBLIC FUNDS OF APPROXIMATELY 56.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (APRIL 2018)IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE WHAT GROUPS OF CHILDREN ARE SERVED BY CORE CHILDHOOD SOCIAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS -- INCLUDING MEDICAID, EITC, CTC, SNAP, AND AFDC/TANF -- AND HOW THEY HAVE CHANGED OVER TIME. WE FIND THAT VIRTUALLY ALL GAINS IN SPENDING ON THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET FOR CHILDREN SINCE 1990 HAVE GONE TO FAMILIES WITH EARNINGS, AND TO FAMILIES WITH INCOME ABOVE THE POVERTY LINE. THESE TRENDS ARE THE RESULT OF WELFARE REFORM AND THE EXPANSION OF IN-WORK TAX CREDITS. WE REVIEW THE AVAILABLE RESEARCH AND FIND THAT ACCESS TO SAFETY NET PROGRAMS DURING CHILDHOOD IMPROVES OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND SOCIETY OVER THE LONG RUN. THIS EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE RECENT CHANGES TO THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET MAY HAVE LASTING NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE POOREST CHILDREN.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (AUGUST 2014)THIS STUDY PROVIDES THE FIRST COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS OF THE DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF HEAD START, USING THE FIRST NATIONAL RANDOMIZED EXPERIMENT OF THE HEAD START PROGRAM (THE HEAD START IMPACT STUDY). WE EXAMINE PROGRAM EFFECTS ON COGNITIVE AND NON-COGNITIVE OUTCOMES AND EXPLORE THE HETEROGENEOUS EFFECTS OF THE PROGRAM THROUGH 1ST GRADE BY ESTIMATING QUANTILE TREATMENT EFFECTS UNDER ENDOGENEITY (IV-QTE) AS WELL AS VARIOUS TYPES OF SUBGROUP MEAN TREATMENT EFFECTS AND TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES TREATMENT EFFECTS. WE FIND THAT (THE EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATED) HEAD START ATTENDANCE LEADS TO LARGE AND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT GAINS IN COGNITIVE ACHIEVEMENT DURING THE PRE-SCHOOL PERIOD AND THAT THE GAINS ARE LARGEST AT THE BOTTOM OF THE DISTRIBUTION. ONCE THE CHILDREN ENTER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, THE COGNITIVE GAINS FADE OUT FOR THE FULL POPULATION, BUT IMPORTANTLY, COGNITIVE GAINS PERSIST THROUGH 1ST GRADE FOR SOME SPANISH SPEAKERS. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE STRONG EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OF A COMPENSATORY MODEL OF THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY, OUR FINDINGS OF LARGE EFFECTS AT THE BOTTOM ARE CONSISTENT WITH AN INTERPRETATION THAT THE RELATIVELY LARGE GAINS IN THE WELL-STUDIED PERRY PRESCHOOL PROGRAM ARE IN PART DUE TO THE LOW BASELINE SKILLS IN THE PERRY STUDY POPULATION. WE FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT THE COUNTERFACTUAL CARE SETTING PLAYS A LARGE ROLE IN EXPLAINING THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE HSIS AND PERRY FINDINGS.DOWNLOAD

									PUBLISHED PAPER (2MB)BRONCHETTI, ERIN, GARRET CHRISTENSEN AND HILARY HOYNES “LOCAL FOOD PRICES, SNAP PURCHASING POWER, AND CHILD HEALTH,” THE JOURNAL OF HEALTH ECONOMICS, VOLUME 68, DECEMBER 2019.THE SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM (SNAP, FORMERLY FOOD STAMPS) IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET. UNLIKE MOST OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS, SNAP VARIES LITTLE ACROSS STATES AND OVER TIME, WHICH CREATES CHALLENGES FOR QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION. NOTABLY, SNAP BENEFITS ARE FIXED ACROSS 48 STATES; BUT LOCAL FOOD PRICES VARY, LEADING TO GEOGRAPHIC VARIATION IN THE REAL VALUE – OR PURCHASING POWER – OF SNAP BENEFITS. IN THIS STUDY, WE PROVIDE THE FIRST ESTIMATES THAT LEVERAGE VARIATION IN SNAP PURCHASING POWER ACROSS MARKETS TO EXAMINE EFFECTS OF SNAP ON CHILD HEALTH. WE LINK PANEL DATA ON REGIONAL FOOD PRICES TO NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY DATA AND USE A FIXED EFFECTS FRAMEWORK TO ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN LOCAL PURCHASING POWER OF SNAP AND CHILDREN’S HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION. WE FIND THAT LOWER SNAP PURCHASING POWER LEADS TO LOWER UTILIZATION OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE AND MORE DAYS OF SCHOOL MISSED DUE TO ILLNESS. WE ESTIMATE NO EFFECT ON PARENT-REPORTED HEALTH STATUS.DOWNLOAD

A FEATURE OF ADVANCED ECONOMIES THAT DISTINGUISHES THEM FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS THE EXISTENCE OF WELL DEVELOPED, IF OFTEN INCOMPLETE, SAFETY NETS. WE DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR DESCRIBING TRANSFER PROGRAMS, FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ENCOMPASS MOST EXISTING PROGRAMS AS WELL AS UBIS, AND USE THIS FRAMEWORK TO COMPARE VARIOUS UBIS TO THE EXISTING CONSTELLATION OF PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES. A UBI WOULD DIRECT MUCH LARGER SHARES OF TRANSFERS TO CHILDLESS, NON-ELDERLY, NON-DISABLED HOUSEHOLDS THAN EXISTING PROGRAMS, AND MUCH MORE TO MIDDLE-INCOME RATHER THAN POOR HOUSEHOLDS. A UBI LARGE ENOUGH TO INCREASE TRANSFERS TO LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WOULD BE ENORMOUSLY EXPENSIVE. WE REVIEW THE LABOR SUPPLY LITERATURE FOR EVIDENCE ON THE LIKELY IMPACTS OF A UBI. WE ARGUE THAT THE ONGOING UBI PILOT STUDIES WILL DO LITTLE TO RESOLVE THE MAJOR OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS.DOWNLOAD

WE FIND THAT VIRTUALLY ALL GAINS IN SPENDING ON THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET FOR CHILDREN SINCE 1990 HAVE GONE TO FAMILIES WITH EARNINGS, AND TO FAMILIES WITH INCOME ABOVE THE POVERTY LINE. THESE TRENDS ARE THE RESULT OF WELFARE REFORM AND THE EXPANSION OF IN-WORK TAX CREDITS. WE REVIEW THE AVAILABLE RESEARCH AND FIND THAT ACCESS TO SAFETY NET PROGRAMS DURING CHILDHOOD IMPROVES OUTCOMES FOR CHILDREN AND SOCIETY OVER THE LONG RUN. THIS EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE RECENT CHANGES TO THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET MAY HAVE LASTING NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE POOREST CHILDREN.DOWNLOAD

									NBER WORKING PAPER 24594 JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES 53:859-890, 2018; (JOINT WITH ANKUR PATEL)WE EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF THE EITC ON THE POVERTY AND INCOME OF SINGLE MOTHERS WITH CHILDREN USING A QUASI-EXPERIMENT APPROACH THAT LEVERAGES VARIATION IN GENEROSITY DUE TO POLICY EXPANSIONS ACROSS TAX YEARS AND FAMILY SIZES. WE FIND THAT THE INCOME INCREASING EFFECTS OF THE EITC ARE CONCENTRATED BETWEEN 75% AND 150% OF INCOME-TO-POVERTY WITH LITTLE EFFECT AT THE LOWEST INCOME LEVELS (50% POVERTY AND BELOW) AND AT LEVELS OF 250% OF POVERTY AND HIGHER. SPECIFICALLY, A POLICY-INDUCED $1000 INCREASE IN THE EITC LEADS TO AN 8.4 PERCENTAGE POINT REDUCTION IN THE SHARE OF FAMILIES WITH AFTER TAX AND TRANSFER INCOME BELOW 100% POVERTY. THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO A RICH SET OF CONTROLS AND WHETHER WE COMPARE SINGLE WOMEN WITH AND WITHOUT CHILDREN OR COMPARE WOMEN WITH ONE CHILD VERSUS WOMEN WITH TWO OR MORE CHILDREN. THEY ARE ALSO ROBUST TO WHETHER WE LIMIT OUR ANALYSIS TO THE SHARP INCREASE IN THE 1993 EXPANSION OR USE THE FULL PERIOD OF POLICY EXPANSION, BACK TO THE 1986 TAX REFORM ACT. IMPORTANTLY, EVENT STUDY ESTIMATES SHOW NO EVIDENCE OF DIFFERENTIAL PRE-TRENDS, PROVIDING STRONG EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF OUR RESEARCH DESIGN. WE USE THESE RESULTS TO SHOW THAT BY CAPTURING THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE CREDIT ON EARNINGS, STATIC CALCULATIONS OF THE ANTI-POVERTY EFFECTS OF THE EITC (SUCH AS THOSE RELEASED BASED ON THE SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE) MAY BE UNDERESTIMATED BY ALMOST 50 PERCENT. OURS IS THE FIRST PAPER TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ESTIMATE THE COMBINED DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS OF THE EITC, TO QUANTIFY HOW MUCH WE MISS BY IGNORING THE BEHAVIOR EFFECT, AND TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECTS ACROSS THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION. DOWNLOAD

RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT IT ALSO REDUCES POVERTY AND IMPROVES HEALTH AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES. THE MAXIMUM CREDIT FOR FAMILIES WITH TWO OR FEWER CHILDREN HAS REMAINED FLAT IN INFLATION-ADJUSTED TERMS SINCE 1996. OVER THE SAME PERIOD, EARNINGS PROSPECTS HAVE STAGNATED OR DIMINISHED FOR MANY AMERICANS, AND PRIME-AGE EMPLOYMENT RATES HAVE FALLEN. THIS PAPER PROPOSES TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES OF THE EITC WITH A TEN PERCENT ACROSSTHE-BOARD INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL CREDIT. THIS EXPANSION WOULD PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL OFFSET TO STAGNATING REAL WAGES, ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO ENTER EMPLOYMENT, LIFT APPROXIMATELY 600,000 INDIVIDUALS OUT OF POVERTY, AND IMPROVE HEALTH AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES FOR MILLIONS OF CHILDREN.DOWNLOAD

									FINAL VERSION [ACCEPTED JPAM] (854KB)MARIANNE BITLER, HILARY HOYNES AND ELIRA KUKA, 2017. JOURNAL OF HUMAN RESOURCES VOL 36, ISSUE 2, PP. 358-389.THE CASH AND NEAR CASH SAFETY NET IN THE U.S. HAS UNDERGONE A DRAMATIC TRANSFORMATION IN THE PAST FIFTEEN YEARS. FEDERAL WELFARE REFORM HAS LED TO THE “ELIMINATION OF WELFARE AS WE KNOW IT” AND SEVERAL TAX REFORMS HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED THE ROLE OF “IN-WORK”' ASSISTANCE. IN 2012, WE SPENT MORE THAN 7 DOLLARS ON THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT (EITC) FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON CASH BENEFITS THROUGH TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES (TANF), WHEREAS IN 1994 ON THE EVE OF FEDERAL WELFARE REFORM THESE PROGRAMS WERE ABOUT EQUAL IN SIZE. IN THIS PAPER, WE EVALUATE AND TEST WHETHER THE EITC DEMONSTRATES A DEFINING FEATURE OF A SAFETY NET PROGRAM—THAT IT RESPONDS TO ECONOMIC NEED. IN PARTICULAR, WE EXPLORE HOW EITC PARTICIPATION AND EXPENDITURES CHANGE WITH THE BUSINESS CYCLE. THE FACT THAT THE EITC REQUIRES EARNED INCOME LEADS TO A THEORETICAL AMBIGUITY IN THE CYCLICAL RESPONSIVENESS OF THE CREDIT. WE USE ADMINISTRATIVE IRS DATA TO EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BUSINESS CYCLES AND THE EITC PROGRAM. OUR EMPIRICAL STRATEGY RELIES ON EXPLOITING DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AND SEVERITY OF ECONOMIC CYCLES ACROSS STATES. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT RATES LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN EITC RECIPIENTS AND TOTAL DOLLAR AMOUNTS OF CREDITS FOR MARRIED COUPLES. ON THE OTHER HAND, THE EFFECT OF BUSINESS CYCLES ON USE OF THE EITC IS INSIGNIFICANT FOR SINGLE INDIVIDUALS, WHETHER MEASURED BY THE NUMBER OF RECIPIENTS OR EXPENDITURES. ESTIMATES THAT FURTHER CUT BY EDUCATION SHOW THAT THE PROTECTIVE EFFECTS OF THE EITC ARE CONCENTRATED AMONG THOSE WITH HIGHER SKILLS (AND POTENTIAL EARNINGS). IN SUM, OUR RESULTS SHOW THAT THE EITC SERVES TO MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF INCOME SHOCKS FOR MARRIED COUPLES WITH CHILDREN AND OTHER GROUPS LIKELY TO HAVE MODERATE EARNINGS, BUT DOES NOT DO SO FOR THE MAJORITY OF RECIPIENTS—SINGLE PARENTS WITH CHILDREN. THE PATTERNS WE IDENTIFY ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF STATIC LABOR SUPPLY THEORY, WHICH WE CONFIRM WITH AN ANALYSIS OF EARNINGS, AND WITH EXPECTATIONS ABOUT HOW ECONOMIC SHOCKS ARE LIKELY TO VARY ACROSS FAMILY TYPE AND SKILL GROUP.DOWNLOAD

WE REVIEW WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PROGRAM IMPACTS AND DISTRIBUTIONAL CONSEQUENCES UNDER CURRENT LAW, DRAWING ON SIMULATIONS FROM THE TAX POLICY CENTER. WE CONCLUDE THAT THE EITC IS QUITE SUCCESSFUL IN MEETING ITS THREE GOALS. IN CONTRAST, MOST OF THE BENEFITS OF THE CTC GO TO HIGHER INCOME HOUSEHOLDS.

FIRST, TANF FAILS TO REACH A SIZEABLE SHARE OF NEEDY FAMILIES, DOES LITTLE TO REDUCE DEEP POVERTY, AND IS NOT TARGETED TO THE MOST NEEDY. SECOND, IN ITS CURRENT FORM THE PROGRAM DOES NOT AUTOMATICALLY EXPAND DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS, WHEN THE NEED FOR THE PROGRAM IS LIKELY GREATEST AND THE ADDITIONAL CONSUMER SPENDING WOULD BE PARTICULARLY WELCOME.

APRIL 2016.A GROWING ECONOMICS LITERATURE ESTABLISHES A CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN IN UTERO SHOCKS AND HEALTH AND HUMAN CAPITAL IN ADULTHOOD. MOST STUDIES RELY ON EXTREME NEGATIVE SHOCKS SUCH AS FAMINE AND PANDEMICS. WE ARE THE FIRST TO EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF A POSITIVE AND POLICY-DRIVEN CHANGE IN ECONOMIC RESOURCES AVAILABLE IN UTERO AND DURING CHILDHOOD. IN PARTICULAR, WE FOCUS ON THE INTRODUCTION OF A KEY ELEMENT OF THE U.S. SAFETY NET, THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM, WHICH WAS ROLLED OUT ACROSS COUNTIES IN THE U.S. BETWEEN 1961 AND 1975. WE USE THE PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS TO ASSEMBLE UNIQUE DATA LINKING FAMILY BACKGROUND AND COUNTY OF RESIDENCE IN EARLY CHILDHOOD TO ADULT HEALTH AND ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. THE IDENTIFICATION COMES FROM VARIATION ACROSS COUNTIES AND OVER BIRTH COHORTS IN AVAILABILITY OF THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM. OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE FOOD STAMP PROGRAM HAS EFFECTS DECADES AFTER INITIAL EXPOSURE. SPECIFICALLY, ACCESS TO FOOD STAMPS IN CHILDHOOD LEADS TO A SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN THE INCIDENCE OF “METABOLIC SYNDROME” (OBESITY, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE, AND DIABETES) AND, FOR WOMEN, AN INCREASE IN ECONOMIC SELF-SUFFICIENCY. OVERALL, OUR RESULTS SUGGEST SUBSTANTIAL INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL BENEFITS OF THE SAFETY NET THAT HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY BEEN QUANTIFIED.DOWNLOAD

IN THIS PAPER WE EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN POVERTY, THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET, AND BUSINESS CYCLES HISTORICALLY AND TEST WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THIS RELATIONSHIP DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. WE DO SO USING AN ALTERNATIVE MEASURE OF POVERTY THAT INCORPORATES TAXES AND IN-KIND TRANSFERS. WE EXPLORE THE MEDIATING ROLE PLAYED BY FOUR CORE SAFETY NET PROGRAMS—FOOD STAMPS, CASH WELFARE (AFDC/TANF), THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT, AND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE—IN BUFFERING FAMILIES FROM NEGATIVE ECONOMIC SHOCKS. THIS ANALYSIS YIELDS SEVERAL IMPORTANT FINDINGS. OUR MOST ROBUST AND IMPORTANT FINDING IS THE SAFETY NET IS DOING LESS TO PROVIDE PROTECTION FOR THE MOST DISADVANTAGED. IN THE POST-WELFARE REFORM WORLD, TANF DID NOT RESPOND IN THE GREAT RECESSION AND EXTREME POVERTY IS MORE CYCLICAL THAN IN PRIOR RECESSIONS. ON THE OTHER HAND, FOOD STAMPS AND UI ARE PROVIDING MORE PROTECTION¬-OR AT LEAST PROVIDING NO LESS PROTECTION-IN THE GREAT RECESSION, ALTHOUGH THESE RESULTS ARE LESS ROBUST ACROSS OUR DIFFERENT MODELS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE MORE LIKELY TO AFFECT HOUSEHOLDS SOMEWHAT HIGHER UP THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION; WE FIND SOME EVIDENCE OF A REDUCTION IN CYCLICALITY AT 100% POVERTY AND LITTLE EVIDENCE ABOUT THIS AT HIGHER INCOME-TO-POVERTY LEVELS.DOWNLOAD

ZILIAK, STANFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS, NOVEMBER 2015.IN THIS CHAPTER, WE DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SNAP AND FOOD CONSUMPTION. WE FIRST PRESENT THE NEOCLASSICAL FRAMEWORK FOR ANALYZING IN-KIND TRANSFERS, WHICH UNAMBIGUOUSLY PREDICTS THAT SNAP WILL INCREASE FOOD CONSUMPTION, AND FOLLOW THIS WITH AN EXPLANATION OF THE SNAP BENEFIT FORMULA. WE THEN PRESENT NEW EVIDENCE FROM THE CONSUMER EXPENDITURE SURVEY ON FOOD SPENDING PATTERNS AMONG HOUSEHOLDS OVERALL, SNAP HOUSEHOLDS, AND OTHER SUBGROUPS OF INTEREST. WE FIND THAT A SUBSTANTIAL FRACTION OF SNAP HOUSEHOLDS SPEND AN AMOUNT THAT IS ABOVE THE PROGRAM’S NEEDS STANDARD. WE ALSO SHOW THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FAMILY SIZE AND FOOD SPENDING IS STEEPER THAN THE SLOPE OF THE SNAP NEEDS PARAMETER, AND THAT LARGE FAMILIES ARE MORE LIKELY THAN SMALL FAMILIES TO SPEND LESS ON FOOD THAN THE NEEDS STANDARD AMOUNT. ACTUAL BENEFIT LEVELS ARE SMALLER THAN THE NEEDS STANDARDS, AND WE FIND THAT MOST FAMILIES SPEND MORE ON FOOD THAN THEIR PREDICTED BENEFIT ALLOTMENT. BECAUSE OF THIS, ACCORDING TO THE NEOCLASSICAL MODEL, MOST FAMILIES ARE PREDICTED TO TREAT THEIR BENEFITS LIKE CASH.DOWNLOAD

USING TAX-REFORM INDUCED VARIATION IN THE FEDERAL EITC, WE EXAMINE THE IMPACT OF THE CREDIT ON INFANT HEALTH OUTCOMES. WE FIND THAT INCREASED EITC INCOME REDUCES THE INCIDENCE OF LOW BIRTH WEIGHT AND INCREASES MEAN BIRTH WEIGHT.  FOR SINGLE LOW EDUCATION (12 YEARS OR LESS) MOTHERS, A POLICY-INDUCED TREATMENT ON THE TREATED INCREASE OF $1000 IN AFTER-TAX INCOME IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 0.17 TO 0.31 PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN LOW BIRTH WEIGHT STATUS.  GIVEN ROUGHLY 10.7% OF TREATED CHILDREN WERE LOW BIRTH WEIGHT, THIS REPRESENTS A 1.6% TO 2.9% DECLINE.  THESE IMPACTS ARE EVIDENT WITH DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE MODELS AND EVENT STUDY ANALYSES, AND SHOW LARGER IMPACTS FOR BIRTHS TO AFRICAN AMERICAN MOTHERS. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST THAT PART OF THE MECHANISM FOR THIS IMPROVEMENT IN BIRTH OUTCOMES IS THE RESULT OF MORE PRENATAL CARE AND LESS NEGATIVE HEALTH BEHAVIORS (SMOKING). ADDITIONALLY, WE FIND A SHIFT FROM PUBLIC TO PRIVATE INSURANCE COVERAGE, AND FOR SOME A REDUCTION IN INSURANCE OVERALL, INDICATING A POTENTIAL CHANGE IN THE QUALITY AND PERHAPS QUANTITY OF COVERAGE.  WE CONTRIBUTE TO THE LITERATURE BY ESTABLISHING THAT A POLICY-DRIVEN INCREASE IN INCOME AND LABOR SUPPLY CAN IMPROVE HEALTH, AND ILLUSTRATING A HEALTH IMPACT OF A NON-HEALTH PROGRAM.

THE PAPER DECOMPOSES THIS TOTAL VALUE INTO TWO COMPONENTS: REDISTRIBUTIVE VALUE, WHICH IS DUE TO PREDICTABLE CHANGES IN INCOME (AND FAMILY CIRCUMSTANCES), AND INSURANCE VALUE, WHICH OCCURS WHEN TAXES AND TRANSFERS COMPENSATE FOR UNEXPECTED INCOME SHOCKS. OUR APPROACH IS A FORWARD-LOOKING ONE, WHERE WE EXAMINE INCOME AND TRANSFERS NET OF TAXES OVER A 10-YEAR PERIOD.

JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS 95, 813–827 (2011).THE GOAL OF FEDERAL FOOD AND NUTRITION PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES IS TO IMPROVE THE NUTRITIONAL WELL-BEING AND HEALTH OF LOW INCOME FAMILIES. A LARGE BODY OF LITERATURE EVALUATES THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAM FOR WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN (WIC) HAS ACCOMPLISHED THIS GOAL, BUT MOST STUDIES HAVE BEEN BASED ON RESEARCH DESIGNS THAT COMPARE PROGRAM PARTICIPANTS TO NON-PARTICIPANTS. IF SELECTION INTO THESE PROGRAMS IS NON-RANDOM THEN SUCH COMPARISONS WILL LEAD TO BIASED ESTIMATES OF THE PROGRAM'S TRUE EFFECTS. IN THIS STUDY WE USE THE ROLLOUT OF THE WIC PROGRAM ACROSS COUNTIES TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF THE PROGRAM ON INFANT HEALTH. WE FIND THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF WIC LED TO AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE BIRTH WEIGHT AND A DECREASE IN THE FRACTION OF BIRTHS THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS LOW BIRTH WEIGHT. WE FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT THESE ESTIMATES ARE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN FERTILITY OR SELECTION INTO LIVE BIRTHS.

BROOKINGS PAPERS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY FALL 2010, PP. 71-127.THE 1996 WELFARE REFORM LED TO SWEEPING CHANGES TO THE CENTRAL CASH SAFETY NET PROGRAM FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. ALONG WITH OTHER CHANGES, THE REFORM IMPOSED LIFETIME TIME LIMITS FOR RECEIPT OF CASH WELFARE, EFFECTIVELY ENDING ITS ENTITLEMENT NATURE FOR THESE FAMILIES. DESPITE DIRE PREDICTIONS, PREVIOUS RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT PROGRAM CASELOADS DECLINED AND EMPLOYMENT INCREASED, WITH NO DETECTIBLE INCREASE IN POVERTY OR WORSENING OF CHILD WELL-BEING. WE REEVALUATE THESE RESULTS IN LIGHT OF THE SEVERE 2007–09 RECESSION. IN PARTICULAR, WE EXAMINE HOW WELFARE REFORM HAS ALTERED THE CYCLICALITY OF THE RESPONSE OF CASELOADS AND FAMILY WELL-BEING. WE FIND THAT USE OF FOOD STAMPS AND NONCASH SAFETY NET PROGRAM PARTICIPATION HAVE BECOME SIGNIFICANTLY MORE RESPONSIVE TO THE ECONOMIC CYCLE AFTER WELFARE REFORM, RISING MORE WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASES. BY CONTRAST, WE FIND NO EVIDENCE THAT CASH WELFARE FOR FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN IS MORE RESPONSIVE, AND SOME EVIDENCE THAT IT MIGHT BE LESS SO. WE FIND SOME EVIDENCE THAT POVERTY INCREASES MORE WITH INCREASES IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE AFTER REFORM, AND NONE THAT IT INCREASES LESS. WE FIND NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF REFORM ON THE CYCLICAL RESPONSIVENESS OF FOOD CONSUMPTION, FOOD INSECURITY, HEALTH INSURANCE, HOUSEHOLD CROWDING, OR HEALTH.DOWNLOAD

DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACTS OF THE SELF SUFFICIENCY PROJECT, JOURNAL OF PUBLIC ECONOMICS, VOLUME 92, ISSUES 3-4, PAGES 748-765, APRIL 2008 (WITH MARIANNE BITLER AND JONAH GELBACH).A LARGE LITERATURE HAS BEEN CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACTS OF RECENT WELFARE REFORMS ON INCOME, EARNINGS, TRANSFERS, AND LABOR-FORCE ATTACHMENT. WHILE ONE STRAND OF THIS LITERATURE RELIES ON OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES CONDUCTED WITH LARGE SURVEY-SAMPLE DATA SETS, A SECOND MAKES USE OF DATA GENERATED BY EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATIONS OF CHANGES TO MEANS-TESTED PROGRAMS. MUCH OF THE OVERALL LITERATURE HAS FOCUSED ON MEAN IMPACTS. IN THIS PAPER, WE USE RANDOM-ASSIGNMENT EXPERIMENTAL DATA FROM CANADA'S SELF-SUFFICIENCY PROJECT (SSP) TO LOOK AT IMPACTS OF THIS UNIQUE REFORM ON THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF INCOME, EARNINGS, AND TRANSFERS. SSP OFFERED MEMBERS OF THE TREATMENT GROUP A GENEROUS SUBSIDY FOR WORKING FULL TIME. QUANTILE TREATMENT EFFECT (QTE) ESTIMATES SHOW THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE HETEROGENEITY IN THE IMPACTS OF SSP ON THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF EARNINGS, TRANSFERS, AND TOTAL INCOME; THIS HETEROGENEITY WOULD BE MISSED BY LOOKING ONLY AT AVERAGE TREATMENT EFFECTS. MOREOVER, THESE HETEROGENEOUS IMPACTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PREDICTIONS OF LABOR SUPPLY THEORY. DURING THE PERIOD WHEN THE SUBSIDY IS AVAILABLE, THE SSP IMPACT ON THE EARNINGS DISTRIBUTION IS ZERO FOR THE BOTTOM HALF OF THE DISTRIBUTION. THE QUANTILES OF THE SSP EARNINGS DISTRIBUTION ARE HIGHER FOR MUCH OF THE UPPER THIRD OF THE DISTRIBUTION EXCEPT AT THE VERY TOP, WHERE THE QUANTILES OF THE EARNINGS DISTRIBUTION ARE THE SAME UNDER EITHER PROGRAM OR POSSIBLY LOWER UNDER SSP. FURTHER, DURING THE PERIOD WHEN SSP RECEIPT WAS POSSIBLE, THE IMPACTS ON THE QUANTILES OF THE DISTRIBUTIONS OF TRANSFER PAYMENTS (INCOME ASSISTANCE PLUS THE SUBSIDY) AND TOTAL INCOME (EARNINGS PLUS TRANSFERS) ARE ALSO DIFFERENT AT DIFFERENT POINTS OF THE DISTRIBUTION. IN PARTICULAR, POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE QUANTILES OF THE TRANSFER DISTRIBUTION ARE CONCENTRATED AT THE LOWER END OF THE TRANSFER DISTRIBUTION, WHILE POSITIVE IMPACTS ON THE QUANTILES OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION ARE CONCENTRATED IN THE UPPER END OF THE INCOME DISTRIBUTION. IMPACTS OF SSP ON THESE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE ESSENTIALLY ZERO AFTER THE SUBSIDY WAS NO LONGER AVAILABLE.DOWNLOAD

WE INVESTIGATE THE IMPORTANCE OF HETEROGENEITY USING RANDOM-ASSIGNMENT DATA FROM CONNECTICUT'S JOBS FIRST WAIVER, WHICH FEATURES KEY ELEMENTS OF POST-1996 WELFARE PROGRAMS. ESTIMATED QUANTILE TREATMENT EFFECTS EXHIBIT THE SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY PREDICTED BY LABOR SUPPLY THEORY. THUS MEAN IMPACTS MISS A GREAT DEAL. LOOKING SEPARATELY AT SAMPLES OF DROPOUTS AND OTHER WOMEN DOES NOT IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE OF MEAN IMPACTS.

WE FIND THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MACRO-ECONOMY AND POVERTY HAS WEAKENED OVER TIME. NEVERTHELESS, CHANGES IN LABOR MARKET OPPORTUNITIES PREDICT CHANGES IN THE POVERTY RATE RATHER WELL. WE ALSO FIND THAT CHANGES IN FEMALE LABOR SUPPLY SHOULD HAVE REDUCED POVERTY, BUT WAS COUNTERACTED BY AN INCREASE IN THE RATE OF FEMALE HEADSHIP. CHANGES IN THE NUMBER AND COMPOSITION OF IMMIGRANTS AND CHANGES IN THE GENEROSITY OF ANTI-POVERTY PROGRAMS SEEM TO HAVE HAD LITTLE EFFECT.DOWNLOAD

	TWENTY-TWO MILLION FAMILIES CURRENTLY RECEIVE A TOTAL OF $34 BILLION IN BENEFITS FROM THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT (EITC). IN FACT, THE EITC IS THE LARGEST CASH-TRANSFER PROGRAM FOR LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. AN UNUSUAL FEATURE OF THE CREDIT IS ITS EXPLICIT GOAL TO USE THE TAX SYSTEM TO ENCOURAGE AND SUPPORT THOSE WHO CHOOSE TO WORK. A LARGE BODY OF WORK HAS EVALUATED THE LABOR SUPPLY EFFECTS OF THE EITC AND HAS GENERATED SEVERAL IMPORTANT FINDINGS REGARDING THE BEHAVIORAL RESPONSE TO TAXES. PERHAPS THE MAIN LESSON LEARNED FROM THE EVIDENCE IS THE CONFIRMATION THAT REAL RESPONSES TO TAXES ARE IMPORTANT; LABOR SUP- PLY DOES RESPOND TO THE EITC. THE SECOND MAJOR LESSON IS RELATED TO THE NATURE OF THE LABOR SUPPLY RESPONSE. A CONSISTENT FINDING IS THAT LABOR SUPPLY RESPONSES ARE CONCENTRATED ALONG THE EXTENSIVE (ENTRY) MARGIN, RATHER THAN THE INTENSIVE (HOURS WORKED) MARGIN. THIS DISTINCTION HAS IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF TAX-TRANSFER PROGRAMS AND FOR THE WELFARE EVALUATION OF TAX REFORMS.DOWNLOAD

	THE EITC IS CURRENTLY THE LARGEST, FEDERAL CASH-TRANSFER PROGRAM FOR LOW-INCOME FAMILIES, WITH EXPENDITURES OF ALMOST $34 BILLION DOLLARS IN 2002. ADVOCATES OF THE CREDIT ARGUE THAT THIS REDISTRIBUTION OCCURS WITH MUCH LESS DISTORTION TO LABOR SUPPLY THAN THAT CAUSED BY OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE WELFARE SYSTEM. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE HAS ESTABLISHED THAT THE CREDIT “ENCOURAGES WORK EFFORT” AMONG ELIGIBLE FEMALE HOUSEHOLD HEADS. LESS RECOGNIZED IS THE FACT THAT THESE POSITIVE WORK INCENTIVES ARE UNLIKELY TO HOLD AMONG MARRIED COUPLES. THEORY SUGGESTS THAT WHILE PRIMARY EARNERS (TYPICALLY MEN) WOULD INCREASE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION, SECONDARY EARNERS WOULD REDUCE THEIR LABOR SUPPLY IN RESPONSE TO AN EITC. WE STUDY THE HOURS WORKED RESPONSE OF MARRIED COUPLES TO SEVERAL EITC EXPANSIONS BETWEEN 1984 AND 1996. WHILE OUR PRIMARY INTEREST IS THE RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE BUDGET SET INDUCED BY THE EITC, OUR IDENTIFICATION STRATEGY TAKES ACCOUNT OF BUDGET SET CHANGES CAUSED BY FEDERAL TAX POLICY, AS WELL AS CROSS-SECTIONAL DIFFERENCES IN NON-LABOR INCOME AND FAMILY SIZE. WE ESTIMATE REDUCED-FORM HOURS OF WORK EQUATIONS USING INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ENDOGENEITY OF NET OF TAX WAGES AND VIRTUAL INCOME. OUR INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON TAX REFORMS AND TRACE OUT THE BUDGET SET. THE RESULTS SHOW THAT EITC EXPANSIONS BETWEEN 1984 AND 1996 LED TO MODEST REDUCTIONS IN HOURS WORKED BY MARRIED MEN AND MARRIED WOMEN. OVERALL, MARRIED WOMEN IN THE LABOR FORCE ARE ESTIMATED TO DECREASE HOURS WORKED BY BETWEEN 1 AND 4 PERCENT. WOMEN IN THE PHASE-OUT RANGE OF THE CREDIT EXPERIENCE THE GREATEST REDUCTIONS, BETWEEN 3 AND 17 PERCENT. OVERALL, THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT FAMILY LABOR SUPPLY AND PRETAX EARNINGS FELL.DOWNLOAD

WE PRESENT ESTIMATES FROM BOTH DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE MODELS (APPLIED TO SINGLE WOMEN AND SINGLE WOMEN WITH CHILDREN) AND DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE MODELS (USING MARRIED WOMEN AND SINGLE WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN AS COMPARISON GROUPS). WE FIND THAT WELFARE REFORM IS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCTIONS IN HEALTH INSURANCE COVERAGE AND SPECIFIC MEASURES OF HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN THE LIKELIHOOD OF NEEDING CARE BUT FINDING IT UNAFFORDABLE. WE FIND NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF REFORM ON HEALTH STATUS. OVERALL, EFFECTS ARE SOMEWHAT LARGER FOR HISPANICS COMPARED TO BLACKS AND LOW EDUCATED WOMEN.DOWNLOAD

(WITH NADA EISSA).A DISTINGUISHING FEATURE OF RECENT CHANGES TO THE US SYSTEM OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE IS ITS INCREASING FOCUS ONWORKING FAMILIES AND RELIANCE ON THE TAX SYSTEM TO TRANSFER DOLLARS TO NEEDY FAMILIES. AFTER A DECADE IN NEAR TOTAL OBSCURITY, THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT (EITC) WAS EXPANDED TO BECOME THE LARGEST CASH-TRANSFER PROGRAM FOR LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN. ADVOCATES OF THE EITC ARGUE THAT, UNLIKE TRADITIONAL WELFARE, THE CREDIT HELPS ‘‘PROMOTE BOTH THE VALUES OF FAMILY AND WORK’’. INDEED, EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE CONSISTENT WITH ECONOMIC THEORY SUGGESTS THAT THE EITC PROMOTES EMPLOYMENT AMONG ELIGIBLE UNMARRIED WOMEN WITH CHILDREN. TO TARGET BENEFITS TO LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES, HOWEVER, THE EITC IS BASED ON FAMILY INCOME, LEADING TO TRADITIONAL WELFARE-TYPE DISINCENTIVES FOR MOST ELIGIBLE SECONDARY EARNERS. IN FACT, THE EITC IS LIKELY TO REDUCE OVERALL FAMILY LABOR SUPPLY AMONG MARRIED COUPLES. THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RESPONSE OF MARRIED COUPLES TO EITC EXPANSIONS BETWEEN 1984 AND 1996. THE EFFECT OF THE CREDIT IS ESTIMATED USING BOTH QUASIEXPERIMENTAL AND TRADITIONAL REDUCED-FORM LABOR SUPPLY MODELS. RESULTS FROM BOTH MODELS SHOW THE SAME QUALITATIVE CONCLUSION, THAT THE EITC EXPANSIONS REDUCED TOTAL FAMILY LABOR SUPPLY OF MARRIED COUPLES. IN ALL CASES, WE FIND A DECLINE IN LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION BY MARRIED WOMEN THAT MORE THAN OFFSETS ANY RISE IN PARTICIPATION BY THEIR SPOUSES. WHILE THE LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE OF MARRIED MEN INCREASED BY ABOUT 0.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS, THAT OF MARRIED WOMEN DECREASED BY JUST OVER A FULL PERCENTAGE POINT. THESE AGGREGATE EFFECTS MASK SUBSTANTIAL HETEROGENEITY IN THE POPULATION. WOMEN FACING THE STRONGEST DISINCENTIVES WERE MORE THAN 2 PERCENTAGE POINTS LESS LIKELY TO WORK AFTER THE EXPANSIONS. THESE FINDINGS IMPLY THAT THE EITC IS EFFECTIVELY SUBSIDIZING MARRIED MOTHERS TO STAY HOME, AND THEREFORE, HAVE IMPLICATIONS FOR THE DESIGN OF THE PROGRAM.DOWNLOAD

THE PRE-REFORM WELFARE SYSTEM WAS WIDELY BELIEVED TO DISCOURAGE MARRIAGE BECAUSE IT PRIMARILY PROVIDED BENEFITS TO SINGLE MOTHERS. HOWEVER, WELFARE REFORM MAY HAVE ACTUALLY DECREASED THE INCENTIVES TO BE MARRIED BY GIVING WOMEN GREATER FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE VIA THE PROGRAM'S NEW EMPHASIS ON WORK. THIS PAPER USES VITAL STATISTICS DATA ON MARRIAGES AND DIVORCES DURING 1989-2000 TO EXAMINE THE ROLE OF WELFARE REFORM (STATE WAIVERS AND TANF IMPLEMENTATION) AND OTHER STATE-LEVEL VARIABLES ON FLOWS INTO AND OUT OF MARRIAGE. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT WELFARE REFORM HAS LED TO FEWER NEW DIVORCES AND FEWER NEW MARRIAGES, ALTHOUGH THE LATTER RESULT IS SENSITIVE TO SPECIFICATION AND DATA CHOICE.

	THE AIM OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE LABOUR MARKET IMPACT OF IN-WORK BENEFIT REFORM IN THE UK. EVIDENCE IS DRAWN FROM THE IMPACT OF EARLIER REFORMS IN THE UK AND SIMILAR REFORMS IN THE US. WE FOCUS ON THE IMPACT ON LABOUR SUPPLY – EMPLOYMENT AND HOURS OF WORK. IN THE US A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN PARTICIPATION AMONG LOW EDUCATED SINGLE PARENTS IN THE 1990S HAS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASED GENEROSITY OF THE EITC. THE IMPACT OF APPARENTLY SIMILAR REFORMS IN THE UK APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SMALLER. WE ARGUE THAT THESE DIFFERENCES CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO FOUR FACTORS: THE IMPACT OF INTERACTIONS WITH OTHER MEANS TESTED BENEFITS IN THE UK; THE IMPORTANCE OF WORKLESS COUPLES WITH CHILDREN IN THE UK, WHO MAKE UP NEARLY 50% OF THE RECIPIENTS IN THE UK; THE LEVEL OF INCOME SUPPORT GIVEN TO NON-WORKING PARENTS IN THE UK; AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ECONOMIC UPTURN IN THE US DURING THE MID 1990S.DOWNLOAD

	PERIODS OF RAPID U.S. ECONOMIC GROWTH DURING THE 1960S AND 1970S COINCIDED WITH IMPROVED LIVING STANDARDS FOR MANY SEGMENTS OF THE POPULATION, INCLUDING THE DISADVANTAGED AS WELL AS THE AFFLUENT, SUGGESTING TO SOME THAT A RISING ECONOMIC TIDE LIFTS ALL DEMOGRAPHIC BOATS. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE IMPACT OF U.S. BUSINESS CYCLE CONDITIONS ON POPULATION WELL-BEING SINCE THE 1970S. AGGREGATE EMPLOYMENT AND HOURS WORKED IN THIS PERIOD ARE STRONGLY PROCYCLICAL, PARTICULARLY FOR LOW-SKILLED WORKERS, WHILE AGGREGATE REAL WAGES ARE ONLY MILDLY PROCYCLICAL. SIMILAR PATTERNS APPEAR IN A BALANCED PANEL OF PSID RESPONDENTS THAT REMOVES THE EFFECTS OF CHANGING WORKFORCE COMPOSITION, THOUGH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE RESPONSIVENESS OF REAL WAGES TO UNEMPLOYMENT APPEARS TO HAVE DECLINED IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. ECONOMIC UPTURNS INCREASE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT WORKERS ACQUIRE JOBS IN SECTORS WITH POSITIVELY SLOPED CAREER LADDERS. SPENDING BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN ALL CATEGORIES RISES DURING ECONOMIC EXPANSIONS, INCLUDING WELFARE SPENDING, FOR WHICH NEEDS VARY COUNTERCYCLICALLY. SINCE THE DISADVANTAGED ARE LIKELY TO BENEFIT DISPROPORTIONATELY FROM SUCH GOVERNMENT SPENDING, IT FOLLOWS THAT THE PUBLIC FINANCES ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO CONVEYING THE BENEFITS OF A STRONG ECONOMY TO DIVERSE POPULATION GROUPS.DOWNLOAD

	IN THIS PAPER, I EXAMINE THE EFFECT OF BUSINESS CYCLES ON THE EMPLOYMENT, EARNINGS, AND INCOME OF PERSONS IN DIFFERENT DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS. I CLASSIFY INDIVIDUALS BY SEX, EDUCATION, AND RACE. THE ANALYSIS USES DATA FROM THE CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY’S OUTGOING ROTATION GROUP FILE, COVERING THE PERIOD 1979-1992, AND MARCH ANNUAL DEMOGRAPHIC FILES (ADF) COVERING THE PERIOD 1975-1997. MANY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY OUTCOME MEASURES ARE CONSIDERED INCLUDING: EMPLOYMENT TO POPULATION RATIOS, WEEKLY EARNINGS, HOURLY EARNINGS, ANNUAL HOURS, ANNUAL EARNINGS, FAMILY EARNINGS, FAMILY TRANSFER INCOME, AND TOTAL FAMILY INCOME. THE REGRESSION MODEL IS SPECIFIED SUCH THAT THE KEY PARAMETERS MEASURE HOW THE LABOR MARKET OUTCOMES OF LESS SKILLED WORKERS VARY WITH THE BUSINESS CYCLE RELATIVE TO THE VARIABILITY FOR HIGH SKILL GROUPS. THE ANALYSIS USES VARIATION ACROSS MSAS IN THE TIMING AND SEVERITY OF SHOCKS. THE RESULTS CONSISTENTLY SHOW THAT INDIVIDUALS WITH LOWER EDUCATION LEVELS, NONWHITES, AND LOW SKILL WOMEN EXPERIENCE GREATER CYCLICAL FLUCTUATION THAN HIGH SKILL MEN. THESE RESULTS ARE THE MOST STRIKING WHEN EXAMINING COMPREHENSIVE MEASURES OF LABOR FORCE ACTIVITY SUCH AS THE LIKELIHOOD OF FULL-TIME YEAR AROUND WORK. GOVERNMENT TRANSFERS AND THE EARNINGS OF OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS DECREASE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GROUPS, AS BUSINESS CYCLES HAVE MORE SKILL-GROUP NEUTRAL EFFECTS ON FAMILY INCOME THAN INDIVIDUAL EARNINGS. THE PAPER EXAMINES THE STABILITY OF THESE RESULTS BY COMPARING EVIDENCE ACROSS THE 1982 AND1992 RECESSIONS. THE EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE 1992 RECESSION LED TO MORE UNIFORM EFFECTS ACROSS SKILL GROUPS THAN EARLIER CYCLES.DOWNLOAD

THIS PAPER EXPLORES WHY THE RESULTS IN THIS LITERATURE ARE SENSITIVE TO THE PRESENCE OF STATE FIXED EFFECTS. IT CONSIDERS ONE NATURAL EXPLANATION, NAMELY THAT THE COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION DIFFERS ACROSS STATES IN WAYS THAT ARE RELATED TO WELFARE PROGRAM GENEROSITY. AFTER CONTROLLING FOR INDIVIDUAL EFFECTS THE RESULTS PROVIDE NO EVIDENCE THAT WELFARE RAISES THE PROPENSITY TO FORM FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS FOR EITHER WHITES OR BLACKS. THESE RESULTS ILLUSTRATE THE POTENTIAL PITFALLS OF ASSUMING THAT STATE FACTORS ARE FIXED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME.

RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS GIVEN A TASK INVOLVING EXTREMELY DIFFICULT ANAGRAMS WERE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO CHEAT. WHITE PARTICIPANTS RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO A CONDITION IN WHICH TWO BLACK CONFEDERATES WERE OBTRUSIVELY SINGLED OUT FOR SCRUTINY BY THE STUDY ADMINISTRATOR CHEATED MORE THAN WHITES IN A WHITE-PROFILING CONDITION AND A NO-PROFILING CONTROL CONDITION, AND MORE THAN BLACK PARTICIPANTS IN ALL THREE CONDITIONS. BLACK PARTICIPANTS CHEATED AT COMPARABLE LEVELS ACROSS THE THREE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS. THE EFFECT OF THE PROFILING OF BLACKS WAS CONSEQUENTLY A NET INCREASE IN CHEATING. THE RESULTS INDICATE THAT RACIAL PROFILING MAY BE COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.DOWNLOAD

RESEARCH IN ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR, 29, 39-69.
	IN THIS ARTICLE, WE RESPOND AT LENGTH TO RECENT CRITIQUES OF RESEARCH ON IMPLICIT BIAS, ESPECIALLY STUDIES USING THE IMPLICIT
	ASSOCIATION TEST (IAT). TETLOCK AND MITCHELL (2009) CLAIM THAT ‘‘THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE IAT RELIABLY PREDICTS CLASS-WIDE
	DISCRIMINATION ON TANGIBLE OUTCOMES IN ANY SETTING,’’ ACCUSE THEIR COLLEAGUES OF VIOLATING ‘‘THE INJUNCTION TO SEPARATE FACTUAL FROM
	VALUE JUDGMENTS,’’ ADHERING BLINDLY TO A ‘‘STATIST INTERVENTIONIST’’ IDEOLOGY, AND OF CONDUCTING A WITCH-HUNT AGAINST IMPLICIT RACISTS,
	SEXISTS, AND OTHERS. THESE AND OTHER CHARGES ARE SPECIOUS. FAR FROM MAKING ‘‘EXTRAORDINARY CLAIMS’’ THAT ‘‘REQUIRE EXTRAORDINARY
	EVIDENCE,’’ RESEARCHERS HAVE IDENTIFIED THE EXISTENCE AND CONSEQUENCES OF IMPLICIT BIAS THROUGH WELL-ESTABLISHED METHODS BASED
	UPON PRINCIPLES OF COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN NEARLY A CENTURY’S WORTH OF WORK. WE CHALLENGE THE BLANKET
	SKEPTICISM AND ORGANIZATIONAL COMPLACENCY ADVOCATED BY TETLOCK AND MITCHELL AND SUMMARIZE 10 RECENT STUDIES THAT NO MANAGER
	(OR MANAGERIAL RESEARCHER) SHOULD IGNORE. THESE STUDIES REVEAL THAT STUDENTS, NURSES, DOCTORS, POLICE OFFICERS, EMPLOYMENT RECRUITERS,
	AND MANY OTHERS EXHIBIT IMPLICIT BIASES WITH RESPECT TO RACE, ETHNICITY, NATIONALITY, GENDER, SOCIAL STATUS, AND OTHER DISTINCTIONS.
	FURTHERMORE—AND CONTRARY TO THE EMPHATIC ASSERTIONS OF THE CRITICS—PARTICIPANTS’ IMPLICIT ASSOCIATIONS DO PREDICT SOCIALLY AND
	ORGANIZATIONALLY SIGNIFICANT BEHAVIORS, INCLUDING EMPLOYMENT, MEDICAL, AND VOTING DECISIONS MADE BY WORKING ADULTS.

	THIS RESEARCH EXAMINES WHETHER SPONTANEOUS, UNINTENTIONAL DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR CAN BE MODERATED BY AN IMPLICIT (NONCONSCIOUS) MOTIVATION TO CONTROL PREJUDICE. WE OPERATIONALIZE IMPLICIT MOTIVATION TO CONTROL PREJUDICE (IMCP) IN TERMS OF AN IMPLICIT NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD PREJUDICE (NAP) AND AN IMPLICIT BELIEF THAT ONESELF IS PREJUDICED (BOP). IN THE PRESENT EXPERIMENT, AN IMPLICIT STEREOTYPIC ASSOCIATION OF BLACKS (VS. WHITES) WITH WEAPONS WAS POSITIVELY CORRELATED WITH THE TENDENCY TO “SHOOT” ARMED BLACK MEN FASTER THAN ARMED WHITE MEN (THE “SHOOTER BIAS”) IN A COMPUTER SIMULATION. HOWEVER, PARTICIPANTS RELATIVELY HIGH IN IMPLICIT NEGATIVE ATTITUDE TOWARD PREJUDICE SHOWED NO RELATION BETWEEN THE RACE-WEAPONS STEREOTYPE AND THE SHOOTER BIAS. IMPLICIT BELIEF THAT ONESELF IS PREJUDICED HAD NO DIRECT EVECT ON THIS RELATION, BUT THE INTERACTION OF NAP AND BOP DID. PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD A STRONG ASSOCIATION BETWEEN SELF AND PREJUDICE (HIGH BOP) BUT A WEAK ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PREJUDICE AND BAD (LOW NAP) SHOWED THE STRONGEST RELATION BETWEEN THE IMPLICIT RACE-WEAPONS STEREOTYPE AND THE SHOOTER BIAS, SUGGESTING THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS FREELY EMPLOYED THEIR STEREOTYPES IN THEIR BEHAVIOR.DOWNLOAD

	THE ROLE OF IMPLICIT MOTIVATION TO CONTROL PREJUDICE (IMCP) IN MODERATING
	THE EFFECT OF RESOURCE DEPLETION ON SPONTANEOUS DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR
	WAS EXAMINED. COGNITIVE RESOURCE DEPLETION WAS MANIPULATED BY HAVING
	PARTICIPANTS SOLVE EITHER DIFFICULT OR EASY ANAGRAMS. A “SHOOTER TASK” MEASURING UNINTENDED RACIAL DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR FOLLOWED. PARTICIPANTS
	THEN REPORTED THEIR SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCES IN THE TASK. FINALLY, IMCP AND
	AN IMPLICIT RACE-WEAPONS STEREOTYPE WERE MEASURED, BOTH USING GO/NO-GO
	ASSOCIATION TASKS (GNATS). IMCP MODERATED THE EFFECT OF DEPLETION ON DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR: DEPLETION RESULTED IN MORE RACIAL BIAS IN THE SHOOTER
	TASK ONLY FOR THOSE WHO SCORED LOW IN OUR MEASURE OF IMCP, WHILE HIGH
	IMCP PARTICIPANTS PERFORMED COMPARABLY IN BOTH THE LOW AND HIGH DEPLETION CONDITIONS.DOWNLOAD

	ANALYZING POLITICAL CONSERVATISM AS MOTIVATED SOCIAL COGNITION INTEGRATES THEORIES OF PERSONALITY (AUTHORITARIANISM, DOGMATISM–INTOLERANCE OF AMBIGUITY), EPISTEMIC AND EXISTENTIAL NEEDS (FOR CLOSURE,
	REGULATORY FOCUS, TERROR MANAGEMENT), AND IDEOLOGICAL RATIONALIZATION (SOCIAL DOMINANCE, SYSTEM JUSTIFICATION). A META-ANALYSIS (88 SAMPLES, 12 COUNTRIES, 22,818 CASES) CONFIRMS THAT SEVERAL PSYCHOLOGICAL
	VARIABLES PREDICT POLITICAL CONSERVATISM: DEATH ANXIETY (WEIGHTED MEAN R  .50); SYSTEM INSTABILITY (.47);
	DOGMATISM–INTOLERANCE OF AMBIGUITY (.34); OPENNESS TO EXPERIENCE (–.32); UNCERTAINTY TOLERANCE (–.27);

GLASER, J., DIXIT, S., & GREEN, D. P. (2002). STUDYING HATE CRIME WITH THE INTERNET: WHAT MAKES RACISTS ADVOCATE RACIAL VIOLENCE. JOURNAL OF SOCIAL ISSUES, 58, 177-193.
	WE CONDUCTED SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 38 PARTICIPANTS IN WHITE RACIST INTERNET CHAT ROOMS, EXAMINING THE EXTENT TO WHICH PEOPLE WOULD, IN THIS UNIQUE ENVIRONMENT, ADVOCATE INTERRACIAL VIOLENCE IN RESPONSE TO PURPORTED ECONOMIC AND CULTURAL THREATS. CAPITALIZING ON THE ANONYMITY AND CANDOR OF CHAT ROOM INTERACTIONS, THIS STUDY PROVIDES AN UNUSUAL PERSPECTIVE ON EXTREMIST ATTITUDES. WE EXPERIMENTALLY MANIPULATED THE NATURE AND PROXIMITY OF THE THREATS. QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE ANALYSES INDICATE THAT THE RESPONDENTS WERE MOST THREATENED BY INTERRACIAL MARRIAGE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, BLACKS MOVING INTO WHITE NEIGHBORHOODS. IN CONTRAST, JOB COMPETITION POSED BY BLACKS EVOKED VERY LITTLE ADVOCACY OF VIOLENCE. THE STUDY AFFORDS AN ASSESSMENT OF THE ADVANTAGES AND LIMITATIONS OF INTERNET-BASED RESEARCH WITH CLANDESTINE POPULATIONS.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (JANUARY 2009)PHILANTHROPISTS HAVE LONG FUNDED A WIDE RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH, PRACTICE, AND POLICY INITIATIVES, PRIMARILY THROUGH NAMESAKE FOUNDATIONS. SOME OBSERVERS HAVE CRITICIZED THESE EFFORTS AS DOING LITTLE TO CHANGE THE STATUS QUO IN EDUCATION AND HAVE CALLED FOR MORE AGGRESSIVE ACTION ON THE PART OF THIS SECTOR. OUT OF THIS CRITIQUE HAS EMERGED A NEW PHILANTHROPIC FORM, OFTEN TERMED VENTURE PHILANTHROPY. PERHAPS NOWHERE IS VENTURE PHILANTHROPY MORE PREVALENT THAN IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL AND POLICY AND ADVOCACY TERRAIN. DRAWING FROM DOCUMENT ANALYSIS AND A REVIEW OF HISTORICAL LITERATURE, THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES A SOCIOPOLITICAL, DESCRIPTIVE DISCUSSION OF THIS “NEW” FORM OF PHILANTHROPY IN SUPPORTING THE CHARTER SCHOOL REFORM NETWORK. IT ALSO EXAMINES THE FUNDING STRATEGIES OF VENTURE PHILANTHROPIES AND THE AREAS OF POLICY INTERSECTION IN PROGRAM INITIATIVES. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES WITH A DISCUSSION OF SOME POLITICAL AND PHILOSOPHICAL TENSIONS THAT VENTURE PHILANTHROPY RAISES AND ALSO PROVIDES SUGGESTIONS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH.DOWNLOAD

WE ARGUE THAT THE SECOND BRANCH OF TFA’S MISSION STATEMENT, WHICH MAINTAINS THAT TFA’S GREATEST POINT OF INFLUENCE IN PUBLIC EDUCATION IS NOT IN CLASSROOMS, BUT IN ITS FACILITATION OF ENTRY INTO LEADERSHIP POSITIONS AIMED AT RESHAPING PUBLIC SCHOOLING, CAN BE BETTER UNDERSTOOD IN TERMS OF THE ORGANIZATION’S: A) INFUSION OF “POLICY ENTREPRENEURS” INTO EDUCATIONAL POLICYMAKING PROCESSES; B) CULTIVATION OF POWERFUL NETWORKS OF ELITE INTERESTS; C) PROMOTION OF “CORPORATE” MODELS OF MANAGERIAL LEADERSHIP; AND, D) RACIAL AND SOCIAL CLASS IDENTITIES OF ITS CORPS MEMBERS THAT FACILITATE ENTRY INTO LEADERSHIP AND POLICY NETWORKS. OUR FRAMEWORK IS INFORMED BY THE EXTANT RESEARCH LITERATURE ON TFA, INTERVIEW DATA FROM MORE THAN 150 ALUMNI AND CORPS MEMBERS, AND OUR OBSERVATIONS OF TFA’S 20TH ANNIVERSARY SUMMIT IN WASHINGTON, D.C., AS AN ILLUSTRATIVE CASE OF TFA’S MESSAGING AND GENERAL ORIENTATION TOWARD EDUCATIONAL REFORM. WE CONCLUDE THAT THIS FRAMEWORK CAN HELP ILLUMINATE UNDER-EXAMINED POLITICAL AND IDEOLOGICAL MOTIVATIONS BEHIND THE ORGANIZATION’S ACTIVITIES.KEYWORDS: TEACH FOR AMERICA, RACIAL INEQUALITY, POLICY ENTREPRENEURS, EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP, URBAN EDUCATIONAL REFORM, POWER NETWORKS DOWNLOAD

AT THE LEGISLATIVE AND REGULATORY LEVELS, POLICYMAKERS HAVE REDEFINED EQUITY IN SCHOOLING TO MEAN PROVIDING PARENTS WITH SUFFICIENT SCHOOL CHOICES TO “BUY” EDUCATION FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THIS FRAMEWORK RECASTS THE ROLE OF THE STATE AS A BROADENING AGENT FOR EDUCATIONAL MARKETS. ALTHOUGH PARENTAL EMPOWERMENT IS SEEMINGLY A CENTRAL GOAL OF THE LEGISLATION, THE LAWS ALSO FACILITATE THE ENTRY OF PRIVATE SECTOR ACTORS INTO THE EDUCATIONAL MARKETPLACE. THE RESULTING CHOICE OPTIONS DEPART FROM REDISTRIBUTIVE FORMS OF EQUITY, ADVANTAGE SOME PARENTS OVER OTHERS, AND ALSO EMPOWER FOR-PROFIT AND NONPROFIT INTERMEDIARIES AND PRIVATE PROVIDERS SEEKING TO GAIN A SHARE OF THE EDUCATIONAL MARKETPLACE.DOWNLOAD

THEY PROPOSE A PROCESS VIEW OF CAUSALITY THAT WOULD ALLOW QUALITATIVE RESEARCHERS TO MAKE CAUSAL CLAIMS MORE GROUNDED IN THE THICK DESCRIPTION OF PRACTICE SETTINGS. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE BUILD ON THIS NOTION OF PROCESS CAUSALITY, BUT FURTHER ARGUE THAT UNLESS WE ALSO BROADEN TRADITIONAL NOTIONS OF CONTEXT IN QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEEK POLICY SOLUTIONS PRIMARILY AT INDIVIDUAL, LOCAL INSTITUTIONAL, AND CULTURAL LEVELS. ALTHOUGH QUALITATIVE RESEARCHERS HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE INTERSECTIONALITY OF RACE, CLASS, AND GENDER AT THE CULTURAL LEVEL, THIS INTERSECTIONALITY SELDOM EXTENDS TO MACRO LEVEL STRUCTURES AND FORCES, IN PART BECAUSE CURRENT NOTIONS OF CAUSALITY MAKE SUCH LINKS DIFFICULT AT LOW LEVELS OF INFERENCE.

DRAWING FROM MULTIDISCIPLINARY RESEARCH, INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL POLICY, HISTORY, AND SOCIOLOGY, AS WELL AS THE VOICES OF CONTEMPORARY EDUCATIONAL REFORMERS, I EXAMINE THE IDEOLOGICAL UNDERPINNINGS AND DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE OF THE MARKET-BASED SCHOOL REFORM MOVEMENT. IN TURN, I JUXTAPOSE THESE ELITE STANCES AND INITIATIVES WITH GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING IN TRADITIONALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES AND ARGUE THAT IT IS THE LATTER WHICH YOKES THEIR EFFORTS TO ISSUES OF JUSTICE, EQUITY, AND VOICE AND ARE FAR MORE DEEPLY CONNECTED TO THE ONGOING STRUGGLE FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND SOCIAL JUSTICE. I CONCLUDE THAT CIVIL RIGHTS CLAIMS IN SUPPORT OF MARKET-BASED CHOICE REFORMS ARE A SEDUCTIVE ATTEMPT TO RECAST CIVIL RIGHTS CONCERNS PRIMARILY AT THE INDIVIDUAL RATHER THAN AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND THEREFORE FAIL TO MAP ONTO BROADER SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL JUSTICE CONCERNS THAT ANIMATE ALTERNATIVE GRASSROOTS ORGANIZING.DOWNLOAD

TO WHAT FACTORS CAN WE ATTRIBUTE THE SEEMING EDUCATIONAL POLICY CONSENSUS FROM WASHINGTON, DC, TO THE STATES AND FROM PHILANTHROPIES AND POLICY ENTREPRENEURS IN URBAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS? HOW SHOULD WE UNDERSTAND OPPOSITION TO THE POLICY MENU? THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES COMMONSENSE UNDERSTANDINGS IN EDUCATION REFORM, WHICH ARE SUPPORTED BY ASSERTIONS THAT MARKET-BASED SCHOOLING OPTIONS ARE SUPERIOR FOR CHILDREN OF COLOR, AND ARGUES THAT A PRIMARY REASON FOR THE POPULARITY OF SUCH REFORMS IS AN UNDEREXAMINED ADVOCACY COALITION, FORMED NOMINALLY AROUND SCHOOL CHOICE, WHILE ALSO ENCOMPASSING SEVERAL OTHER ENTREPRENEURIAL EDUCATIONAL REFORMS. THE ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE OF THIS NETWORK, ARGUING THAT ITS DOMINANCE HAS PRECLUDED AN UNDERSTANDING OF COUNTER ADVOCACY AGAINST SCHOOL CHOICE AND RELATED REFORMS. IT THEN DESCRIBES SEVERAL PAST AND CURRENT MOVEMENTS THAT CHALLENGE COMMONSENSE UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE REFORMS’ CURRENCY, AS A WAY OF PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE REFORMS’ EXPANSION. THE ARTICLE ALSO DISCUSSES THE ACTIVITIES OF GRASSROOTS COMMUNITY GROUPS IN RESPONSE TO MARKET-BASED REFORMS AND ARGUES THAT THESE EFFORTS CAN HELP TO EXPAND PUBLIC DELIBERATION ON COMPLEX MATTERS OF EDUCATIONAL POLICY.

BRIEFLY STATED, THE FORMER RANKS LAWS AS EITHER “STRONG” OR “WEAK” AND THE LATTER IDENTIFIES LAWS AS EITHER “GOOD” OR “BAD.” WE EXAMINE THE LEGISLATION IN LIGHT OF AN ALTERNATIVE FRAMEWORK. SPECIFICALLY, WE CONSIDER HOW THE LAWS INCORPORATE CHOICE, PRODUCTIVE EFFICIENCY, EQUITY, AND SOCIAL COHESION. WE ALSO CONSIDER WHAT POLICY TOOLS, SUCH AS FINANCE, INFORMATION, AND REGULATION ARE PROVIDED IN THE LEGISLATION TO ACHIEVE THESE VALUES. WE FIND THIS FRAMEWORK MORE COMPREHENSIVE THAN CURRENT, NORMATIVE FRAMEWORKS THAT PERVADE CHARTER SCHOOL RESEARCH. THOUGH WE EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR CONTINUED RESEARCH AT THE LOCAL CHARTER SCHOOL LEVEL TO UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LEGISLATION AND IMPLEMENTATION, THIS FRAMEWORK ENABLES OBSERVERS TO MOVE BEYOND VALUE-LADEN DESCRIPTORS OF CHARTER SCHOOL LAWS. DOWNLOAD

JENNA BEDNAR|"JENNA BEDNAR IS A PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AND POLITICAL SCIENCE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AND A MEMBER OF THE EXTERNAL FACULTY AT THE SANTA FE INSTITUTE. PROFESSOR BEDNAR'S RESEARCH IS ON THE ANALYSIS OF INSTITUTIONS, FOCUSING ON THE THEORETICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF THE STABILITY OF FEDERAL STATES. HER MOST RECENT BOOK,THE ROBUST FEDERATION: PRINCIPLES OF DESIGN, DEMONSTRATES HOW COMPLEMENTARY INSTITUTIONS MAINTAIN AND ADJUST THE DISTRIBUTION OF AUTHORITY BETWEEN NATIONAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS. THIS BOOK MAKES TWO THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE STUDY OF FEDERALISM'S DESIGN. FIRST, IT SHOWS THAT DISTRIBUTIONS SUGGESTED BY A CONSTITUTION MEAN NOTHING IF THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE NO INCENTIVE TO ABIDE BY THEM, AND INTERGOVERNMENTAL RETALIATION TENDS TO BE INEFFICIENT.  THE BOOK'S SECOND CONTRIBUTION IS THAT WHILE NO INSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARD IS SUFFICIENT TO IMPROVE THE UNION'S PROSPERITY, INSTITUTIONS WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE COMPLIANCE WITH THE DISTRIBUTION OF AUTHORITY, THEREBY BOOSTING THE UNION'S PERFORMANCE.
GENERALLY, HER WORK SEEKS TO ANSWER QUESTIONS SUCH AS: WHY DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF STATE GOVERNMENTS? WHY ARE SOME FEDERATIONS STABLE, DESPITE FREQUENT EPISODES OF INTERGOVERNMENTAL TENSION? CAN THE COURT EFFECTIVELY REFEREE FEDERALISM DISPUTES IF IT MAKES MISTAKES OR IS BIASED IN FAVOR OF ONE GOVERNMENT?
PROFESSOR BEDNAR IS ALSO INTERESTED IN CONSTITUTIONS: SPECIFICALLY, THE POTENTIAL THAT CONSTITUTIONAL DESIGN HAS TO AFFECT THE BEHAVIOR OF HETEROGENEOUS POPULATIONS WITH DECENTRALIZED GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURES.

	DO PUBLIC SERVICE REFORMS IMPROVE CITIZEN SERVICES? OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES BOTH PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES HAVE BEEN PROMOTED AS TOOLS FOR REFORMING SERVICE DELIVERY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, OBSERVATIONAL STUDIES OF POLICIES INTENDED TO PROMOTE THESE REFORM MODELS ARE HINDERED BY SELECTION BIAS. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATIONS, ON THE  OTHER HAND, CAN BE LIMITED IN THEIR POTENTIAL FOR GENERALIZATION TO BROADER POPULATIONS. IN THIS STUDY, I ADOPT A COMBINED EXPERIMENTAL AND OBSERVATIONAL APPROACH TO EVALUATE THE INDEPENDENT EFFECTS OF PRIVATIZATION AND COMPUTERIZATION IN AN INITIATIVE TO IMPROVE CITIZEN SERVICES IN THE SOUTH INDIAN STATE OF KARNATAKA. THROUGH THE USE OF A CITIZEN SURVEY AND FIELD EXPERIMENT, I SHOW THAT PRIVATIZATION OF SERVICE DELIVERY, COMBINED WITH COMPUTERIZATION, HAS A LARGER POSITIVE EFFECT THAN COMPUTERIZATION ALONE ON A NUMBER OF SERVICE QUALITY MEASURES, INCLUDING THE DEMAND FOR, AND SIZE OF, BRIBES FROM CITIZENS. WHILE PRIVATE, COMPUTERIZED CENTERS DO NOT IMPROVE ALL FACETS OF SERVICE DELIVERY AND, INTERESTINGLY, DO NOT ENGENDER HIGHER LEVELS OF SATISFACTION FROM CITIZENS, THEIR EFFECT ON CORRUPTION IN THE SERVICE DELIVERY PROCESS IS SUBSTANTIAL.WORKING PAPER (DECEMBER 2013)
	CONSTITUENCY SERVICE IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF INDIAN LEGISLATOR ACTIVITY. EARLY INTEREST IN THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PERSONAL VOTE IN INDIA PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE RELEVANCE OF INDIAN ELECTORAL INSTITUTIONS FOR PROMOTING THE SUPPLY OF CONSTITUENCY SERVICE TO INDIAN CITIZENS. YET ANALYSTS HAVE PAID LITTLE ATTENTION TO THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF OTHER INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, SUCH AS THE MAJOR DECENTRALIZATION REFORMS OF THE 1990S, ON THE NATURE OF POLITICIAN-CITIZEN INTERACTIONS. IN THIS PAPER I USE SURVEY EVIDENCE FROM CITIZENS IN THE SOUTH INDIAN STATE OF KARNATAKA TO SHOW THAT, DESPITE NEARLY TWO DECADES OF FORMAL POLITICAL AND FISCAL DECENTRALIZATION IN THE STATE, IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES CITIZENS CONTINUE TO RELY ON THE ASSISTANCE OF STATE-LEVEL POLITICIANS TO NAVIGATE THE STATE BUREAUCRACY RATHER THAN THEIR LOCAL COUNTERPARTS. IN ADDITION I FIND THAT PARTY AFFILIATION, RATHER THAN DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS SUCH AS GENDER OR CASTE, PLAYS A PREDOMINANT ROLE IN SHAPING BOTH WHOM CITIZENS HAVE ASKED FOR HELP IN THE PAST AND WHO THEY EXPECT THEY WOULD ASK FOR HELP IN THE FUTURE. THESE FINDINGS CONTRAST WITH THE LITERATURE ON DECENTRALIZATION THAT EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF DECENTRALIZATION FOR INCREASING THE REPRESENTATION OF MINORITY GROUPS AND HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF PARTY POLITICS IN LINKING CONSTITUENTS TO THEIR REPRESENTATIVES AND THE RESOURCES CONTROLLED BY THOSE REPRESENTATIVES.WORKING PAPER (APRIL 2013)
	HOW IS CORRUPTION ORGANIZED? STUDIES OF CORRUPT BEHAVIOR TO DATE SHED LIGHT ON BOTH THE CAUSES AND CONSEQUENCES OF CORRUPTION. YET WE HAVE LITTLE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW CORRUPT ACTIVITIES ARE STRUCTURED AND THE WAYS IN WHICH RENTS ARE, OR ARE NOT, DISTRIBUTED ACROSS VARIOUS ACTORS—INSIGHTSTHAT WOULD, IN THEORY, PROVE ENLIGHTENING FOR EFFORTS TO REDUCE CORRUPTION. IN THIS PAPER, I ANALYZE THE ORGANIZATION OF CORRUPTION THROUGH A SET OF RELATED QUESTIONS: ARE RENTS FROM A SINGLE BRIBE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS MULTIPLE ACTORS? IF SO, DO DIFFERENT TYPES OF ACTORS BENEFIT DIFFERENTIALLY FROM DIFFERENT TYPES OF CORRUPTION? WHAT FACTORS, SUCH AS THE TYPE OF CORRUPTION OR THE DEGREE OF GOVERNMENT CENTRALIZATION, ARE ASSOCIATED WITH VARIATION IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF RENTS? TO EXPLORE THESE QUESTIONS, I FIRST PRESENT A NEW, THREE-LEVEL TYPOLOGY OF CORRUPTION EMPHASIZING THE TYPE OF ACTOR PAYING A BRIBE AND ROUGHLY REFLECTING THE CHARACTER OF ILLICIT ACTS ACROSS THREE REALMS: HIGH-LEVEL POLICY-MAKING, E.G. BRIBES FOR FAVORABLE LEGISLATION; MID-LEVEL POLICY IMPLEMENTATION, SUCH AS KICKBACKS FOR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS; AND LOW-LEVEL DELIVERY OF PUBLIC SERVICES, FOR EXAMPLE THE PAYMENT OF “SPEED MONEY” BY CITIZENS. I THEN DRAW ON NEW AND ORIGINAL DATA FROM SURVEYS OF INDIAN POLITICIANS TO ASSESS HOW THE DISTRIBUTION OF RENTS ACROSS ACTORS VARIES AS A FUNCTION OF THE TYPE OF CORRUPTION AND THE DEGREE OF GOVERNMENT CENTRALIZATION. I SHOW THAT THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DIVISION OF RENTS ACROSS GOVERNMENT AND NON-GOVERNMENT ACTORS AND THE PERCEIVED DISTRIBUTION OF RENTSIS STRONGLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE TYPE OF CORRUPTION, THOUGH NOT NECESSARILY IN THE WAYS PREDICTED BY EXISTING THEORY. IN ADDITION, I FIND A MIXED RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOVERNMENT CENTRALIZATION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF RENTS. THESE RESULTS VALIDATE THE UTILITY OF A MORE DISAGGREGATED TYPOLOGY OF CORRUPTION AND PROVIDE THE FIRST CLEAR EVIDENCE OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH DIFFERENT POLITICAL ACTORS BENEFIT FROM DIVERSE CORRUPT ACTS.DOWNLOAD

	HOW DO CITIZENS ACCESS THE STATE? WHILE THE NATURE OF CITIZEN-STATE RELATIONS IS A KEY ELEMENT OF DEMOCRACY, MOST ANALYSES FOCUS ON ONLY ONE ELEMENT OF THIS INTERACTION, SUCH AS THE LINKS BETWEEN CITIZENS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES, THE USE OF AN INTERMEDIARY TO FACILITATE SERVICE DELIVERY, OR PAYMENT OF A BRIBE TO A BUREAUCRAT. IN THIS PAPER, I EVALUATE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CITIZENS AND THE STATE IN INDIA, FOCUSING ON THE CHOICES CITIZENS MAKE OVER A RANGE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIES FOR ACCESSING STATE RESOURCES AND THE COMBINATIONS OF THESE STRATEGIES. I CONSIDER POTENTIAL DEMOGRAPHIC, REGIONAL, AND INSTITUTIONAL CAUSES OF VARIATION IN THESE CHOICES AND FIND THAT CITIZENS ENGAGE WITH THE STATE IN QUITE DIFFERENT WAYS DEPENDING ON THE GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT FROM WHICH THEY REQUIRE SERVICES AND THE STATE IN WHICH THEY LIVE. THESE ANALYSES HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF A MORE COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF CITIZEN-STATE INTERACTIONS THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT THE SPECTRUM OF CHOICES CITIZENS MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE FOR ACCESSING PUBLIC SERVICES, THUS PROVIDING A MORE COMPLETE VIEW OF DEMOCRATIC PRACTICE IN INDIA TODAY.

	THE INDIAN CENTRAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROMOTED EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY USING INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES. HOWEVER, STATE-LEVEL EXPERIENCES WITH EGOVERNMENT SINCE THE LATE 1990S DISPLAY SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS IN THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO SUCCESSFULLY ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO CITIZENS. I EVALUATE STATE EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT ONE-STOP, COMPUTERIZED CITIZEN SERVICE CENTERS AND SHOW THAT POLICY OUTCOMES ARE NOT CORRELATED WITH MEASURES OF ESTABLISHED EXPLANATIONS FOR REFORM, SUCH AS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. INSTEAD, I ARGUE THAT VARIATIONS IN POLICIES RESULT FROM THE EXTENT TO WHICH INCUMBENT POLITICIANS EXPECT REFORMS TO AFFECT THE ECONOMIC RESOURCES UNDERLYING THEIR CURRENT AND FUTURE ELECTORAL STATUS—IN PARTICULAR, THE AVAILABILITY OF CORRUPT INCOME FROM THE PROCESS OF SERVICE DELIVERY. I SHOW THAT LEVELS OF PETTY CORRUPTION ARE HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE CHARACTERISTICS OF REFORM AND THESE OUTCOMES ARE MAGNIFIED IN COALITION-LED STATES, WHERE POLITICIANS ANTICIPATE ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM THEIR PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT. ANALYSIS OF FOUR STATES, CHHATTISGARH, TAMIL NADU, KERALA, AND UTTAR PRADESH, ILLUSTRATES THESE DYNAMICS AND HIGHLIGHTS THE WAYS IN WHICH POLITICIANS SIMULTANEOUSLY USE SERVICE REFORMS TO TARGET BENEFITS TO THEIR PREFERRED CONSTITUENTS.DOWNLOAD

BUSSELL, JENNIFER AND ADAM COLLIGAN. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR NATURAL DISASTERS: METHODOLOGY FOR CASE STUDIES IN AFRICA, 2013, CLIMATE CHANGE AND AFRICAN POLITICAL STABILITY PROGRAM RESEARCH BRIEF #9.
	THE CCAPS PROGRAM’S RESEARCH ON INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR NATURAL DISASTERS EXAMINES THE CAUSES OF VARIATION IN GOVERNMENT POLICIES TO REDUCE THE RISK OF, PREPARE FOR, AND RESPOND TO NATURAL DISASTERS. NATURAL HAZARDS, SUCH AS FLOODS, DROUGHT, EARTHQUAKES, AND TROPICAL CYCLONES, DO NOT NECESSARILY RESULT IN DISASTERS, BUT THEY PRESENT A CLEAR POLICY CHALLENGE FOR NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS: HOW DOES A COUNTRY PREPARE FOR THE OFTEN UNEXPECTED? THIS BRIEF PRESENTS THE METHODOLOGIES USED TO INVESTIGATE HOW GOVERNMENTS ANSWER THIS QUESTION. THROUGH A QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS OF TEN AFRICAN COUNTRY CASE STUDIES, THIS STUDY PROVIDES A COMPREHENSIVE EVALUATION OF EXISTING EXPLANATIONS FOR VARIATION IN GOVERNMENT EFFORTS TO DEVELOP DISASTER MANAGEMENT CAPACITIES. THE RESEARCH STRATEGY ALSO HELPS TO OVERCOME LIMITATIONS OF PREVIOUS ANALYSES FOCUSED ON A SMALL NUMBER OF CASES OR INADEQUATE QUANTITATIVE DATA, THEREBY PROVIDING NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE PRACTICE OF DISASTER PREPAREDNESS.DOWNLOAD

BUSSELL, JENNIFER. INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY FOR NATURAL DISASTERS: FINDINGS FROM CASE STUDIES IN AFRICA, 2013, CLIMATE CHANGE AND AFRICAN POLITICAL STABILITY PROGRAM RESEARCH BRIEF #10.
	CCAPS RESEARCH HAS AIMED TO DOCUMENT NATURAL DISASTER RESPONSE CAPACITIES IN AFRICA AND EXPLORE WHAT DRIVES GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT IN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE. THE RESEARCH SHOWS THAT THE TWO CLEAREST PREDICTORS OF INVESTMENT IN PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES ARE ECONOMIC STRENGTH AND PERCEIVED RISK OF NATURAL THREATS. HOWEVER, THESE FACTORS EXPLAIN LITTLE WHEN THERE IS LIMITED ELECTORAL INCENTIVE TO INVEST IN DISASTER MANAGEMENT OR MINIMAL BUREAUCRATIC CAPACITY TO IMPLEMENT PREPAREDNESS PROGRAMS. ELECTORAL CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL DEVELOPMENT AFFECT WHETHER GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE INCENTIVE TO INVEST IN PREPAREDNESS ACTIVITIES AND THE INSTITUTIONAL CAPABILITY TO DO SO. IN ADDITION, DOMESTIC CIVIL SOCIETY AND EXTERNAL ACTORS OFTEN OFFER IMPORTANT SUPPORT TO GOVERNMENTS, AND IT IS THE EXPLICIT FOCUS BY THESE NONSTATE ACTORS ON BOTH PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE THAT SEEMS TO LIMIT THE RISK THAT INTERNATIONAL FUNDING FOR DISASTER PREPAREDNESS WOULD REDUCE DOMESTIC SPENDING ON THAT GOAL IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES CONSIDERED HERE. THESE FINDINGS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS AND INTERNATIONAL AID AGENCIES. BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL ACTORS NEED TO KNOW WHAT CHARACTERISTICS OF STATES MUST BE SUPPORTED TO ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF VULNERABILITY-REDUCING INSTITUTIONS IN THE FACE OF DYNAMIC NATURAL HAZARDS. THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO SHED NEW LIGHT ON THESE ISSUES AND TO INFORM DEBATES OVER THE MOST APPROPRIATE AND EFFICIENT USES OF AID AND NATIONAL RESOURCES FOR ADDRESSING NATURAL SHOCKS.DOWNLOAD

BUSSELL, JENNIFER. CORRUPTION AND REFORM IN INDIA: PUBLIC SERVICES IN THE DIGITAL AGE. NEW YORK: CAMBRIDGE UP, 2012.
	WHY ARE SOME GOVERNMENTS BETTER ABLE TO REFORM PUBLIC SERVICES THAN OTHERS? THROUGH INVESTIGATION OF A NEW ERA OF ADMINISTRATIVE REFORM, IN WHICH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES MAY BE USED TO FACILITATE CITIZENS’ ACCESS TO THE STATE, THIS ANALYSIS PROVIDES UNANTICIPATED INSIGHTS INTO THIS FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION. IN CONTRAST TO FACTORS SUCH AS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OR ELECTORAL COMPETITION, I HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCESS TO RENTS, WHICH CAN DRAMATICALLY SHAPE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND THREATS OF REFORM TO POLITICAL ELITES. DRAWING ON SUB-NATIONAL ANALYSIS OF TWENTY INDIAN STATES, A FIELD EXPERIMENT, STATISTICAL MODELING, INTERVIEWS OF CITIZENS, BUREAUCRATS, AND POLITICIANS, AND COMPARATIVE DATA FROM SOUTH AFRICA AND BRAZIL, I SHOW THAT THE EXTENT TO WHICH POLITICIANS RELY ON INCOME FROM PETTY AND GRAND CORRUPTION IS CLOSELY LINKED TO VARIATION IN THE TIMING, MANAGEMENT, AND COMPREHENSIVENESS OF TECHNOLOGY-ENABLED REFORMS. THE BOOK ALSO ILLUMINATES THE IMPORTANCE OF POLITICAL CONSTITUENCIES AND COALITION POLITICS IN SHAPING POLICY OUTCOMES.
BUSSELL, JENNIFER. EXPLAINING CROSS-NATIONAL VARIATION IN GOVERNMENT TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION, 2011 IN INTERNATIONAL STUDIES QUARTERLY 55(1): 267-280.
	NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES PROVIDE GOVERNMENTS WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER PUBLIC SERVICES MORE EFFECTIVELY TO THEIR CITIZENS. BUT WE KNOW LITTLE ABOUT THE REASONS FOR VARIATION IN THE ADOPTION OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS COUNTRIES. USING CROSS-NATIONAL DATA ON GOVERNMENT USE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES TO REFORM PUBLIC SERVICE DELIVERY, OR EGOVERNMENT, I ARGUE THAT POLITICIANS’ EXPECTATIONS ABOUT THE EFFECTS OF MORE TRANSPARENT SERVICE DELIVERY ON ESTABLISHED PATTERNS OF RENT SEEKING PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SHAPING VARIATION IN THE CHARACTER OF REFORMS. I SHOW THAT THE LEVEL OF PRE-EXISTING CORRUPTION IN A COUNTRY IS A ROBUST PREDICTOR OF EGOVERNMENT OUTCOMES, WITH MORE CORRUPT GOVERNMENTS LESS LIKELY THAN THEIR LESS CORRUPT PEERS TO IMPLEMENT HIGH QUALITY PUBLIC SERVICE REFORMS USING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY. THIS FINDING CONTRASTS WITH THOSE ANALYSES THAT EMPHASIZE THE ROLE OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OR REGIME TYPE IN EXPLAINING TECHNOLOGICAL DIFFUSION.

	ARE POLITICIANS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE DEMANDS OF THEIR CITIZENS? WHAT FACILITATES POLITICAL BEHAVIOR THAT MEETS CITIZEN NEEDS AND DESIRES? UNDER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES WILL CITIZENS REJECT POLITICIANS WHO FAIL IN THIS TASK? THE TWO BOOKS CONSIDERED IN THIS REVIEW ESSAY ATTEMPT TO ANSWER THESE QUESTIONS LARGELY THROUGH EMPIRICAL ANALYSES OF POLITICIAN AND CITIZEN BEHAVIOR. THESE WORKS TOUCH ON TWO DISTINCT BUT RELATED TOPICS IN COMPARATIVE POLITICS—THE ABILITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO GOVERN AND THE REACTION OF CITIZENS TO GOVERNMENT PERFORMANCE. WHILE GRINDLE ASSESSES THE CAPACITY OF GOVERNMENTS TO DEAL WITH CHANGING PATTERNS OF AUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITY, THE CONTRIBUTORS TO THE MARAVALL AND SÁNCHEZ-CUENCA VOLUME FOCUS PRIMARILY ON UNDERSTANDING, FIRST, HOW AND WHY CITIZENS REWARD AND PUNISH POLITICIANS IN PARTICULAR WAYS AND, SECOND, HOW POLITICIANS RESPOND TO THIS EXPECTED BEHAVIOR. IN BOTH CASES, WHILE MANY POTENTIAL STATE AND SOCIETAL CHARACTERISTICS ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT, THE NATURE OF FORMAL INSTITUTIONS PLAYS A PREDOMINANT ROLE
	IN EXPLAINING THE BEHAVIOR OF BOTH POLITICIANS AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS. JENNIFER BUSSELL IS A VISITING FELLOW AT THE CENTER FOR ASIAN DEMOCRACY, UNIVERSITY OF LOUISVILLE.86 INDIA REVIEW GIVEN THE DIFFERING THEORETICAL AGENDAS OF THESE TWO BOOKS, I WILL, FOR THE MOST PART, DISCUSS THEM SEPARATELY. IN BOTH CASES, I WILL FOCUS ON THE RELEVANCE OF THESE ANALYSES, GROUNDED IN GENERAL THEORIES BUT EVALUATED LARGELY IN THE CONTEXT OF WESTERN EUROPE AND MEXICO, FOR
	UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMICS OF POLITICAL BEHAVIOR IN INDIA. IT IS TRUE THAT THE SPECIFIC EMPIRICAL REALITIES EXAMINED HERE MAY HAVE ONLY LIMITED SIMILARITIES WITH MICRO-LEVEL INDIAN POLITICS. WHAT THESE WORKS PROVIDE, RATHER THE PROSPECT OF DIRECT EMPIRICAL COMPARISONS, IS INSTEAD AN OPPORTUNITY FOR BROADENING THE RANGE OF THEORETICAL AND EMPIRICAL ANALYSES IN INDIA. IN OTHER WORDS, I ARGUE THAT THESE WORKS ARE MOST RELEVANT FOR SHEDDING LIGHT ON NEW OR UNDER ANALYZED QUESTIONS WHICH, IF POSED TO THE INDIAN CASE, COULD PROVIDE IMPORTANT NEW INSIGHTS INTO THE BEHAVIOR OF BOTH CITIZENS AND THEIR REPRESENTATIVES.DOWNLOAD

BUSSELL, JENNIFER. WHY GET TECHNICAL? CORRUPTION AND THE POLITICS OF PUBLIC SERVICE REFORM IN THE INDIAN STATES, 2010 IN COMPARATIVE POLITICAL STUDIES 43(10): 1230-1257
	THE EMERGENCE OF NEW INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES IN THE 1990S OFFERED GOVERNMENTS OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER PUBLIC SERVICES MORE EFFECTIVELY TO THEIR CITIZENS.  YET NATIONAL AND SUB-NATIONAL AUTHORITIES HAVE EMPLOYED SUCH TECHNOLOGIES IN HIGHLY UNEVEN WAYS. DRAWING ON A NEW DATASET OF TECHNOLOGY POLICY ADOPTION BY INDIAN STATES, I ARGUE THAT POLITICAL CALCULATIONS DRIVE VARIATION IN THE TIMING AND SCOPE OF TECHNOLOGY POLICIES. POLITICIANS WEIGH THE EXPECTED ELECTORAL BENEFITS FROM PROVIDING NEW GOODS TO CITIZENS AGAINST THE EXPECTED ELECTORAL COSTS OF REDUCED ACCESS TO CORRUPT FUNDS DUE TO INCREASED TRANSPARENCY. I SHOW THAT THE LEVEL OF BUREAUCRATIC CORRUPTION IN A STATE IS THE BEST PREDICTOR OF BOTH WHEN STATES IMPLEMENT POLICIES PROMOTING COMPUTER-ENABLED SERVICES AND THE NUMBER OF SERVICES MADE AVAILABLE. THIS FINDING CONTRASTS WITH ARGUMENTS THAT POSIT ECONOMIC OR DEVELOPMENTAL CONDITIONS, OR ALTERNATIVE ELECTORAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS, AS THE MAJOR DRIVERS OF TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT.

	THIS CONCLUDING ARTICLE RETURNS TO THE BROAD QUESTION THAT MOTIVATES THIS SPECIAL ISSUE OF STUDIES IN COMPARATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT: WILL THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION CONSTITUTE A REVOLUTION IN DEVELOPMENT? IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE, WE EXPLORE A NUMBER OF COMMON THEMES EMPHASIZED BY THE DIFFERENT CONTRIBUTIONS: THE FUTURE OF THE NORTH-SOUTH DIVIDE, THE ROLE OF THE STATE IN PROMOTING DIGITAL DEVELOPMENT, THE TRANSFERABILITY AND ADAPTABILITY OF SPECIFIC INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, THE CHALLENGES AND POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF CONTROLLING DIGITAL INFORMATION, AND THE DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS OF DIGITALLY ENABLED COMMUNITIES. WE ARGUE THAT THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION’S ULTIMATE IMPACT ON DEVELOPMENT WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL KEY VARIABLES, INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE TECHNOLOGIES FOSTER WITHIN-COUNTRY LINKAGES AMONG DIFFERENT SECTORS AND SOCIOECONOMIC CLASSES; THE DEGREE TO WHICH NEW TECHNOLOGICAL APPLICATIONS MAY BE CUSTOMIZED OR TRANSFORMED TO ADVANCE LOCAL DEVELOPMENT; AND THE OUTCOME OF POLITICAL CONTESTS BETWEEN ORGANIZED INTERESTS THAT ARE PROMOTING DIFFERENT WAYS OF ORGANIZING AND GOVERNING THE GLOBAL DIGITAL ECONOMY. WHILE IT IS DIFFICULT TO FULLY ASSESS A TRANSFORMATION WHILE LIVING IN THE MIDST OF IT, RESEARCH ON THE SOCIAL, POLITICAL, AND ECONOMIC IMPLICATIONS OF THE DIGITAL REVOLUTION WILL CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT AGENDA FOR DEVELOPMENT SCHOLARS IN THE YEARS TO COME.DOWNLOAD

DRAWING ON RECENT EXPERIENCES WITH OPEN-SOURCE PROPERTY RIGHTS REGIMES, WE PRESENT TWO SCENARIOS, THE “IMPERIALISM OF PROPERTY RIGHTS” AND THE “SHARED GLOBAL DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE,” TO HIGHLIGHT HOW DEBATES OVER PROPERTY-RIGHTS COULD INFLUENCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GLOBAL DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND, IN TURN, CONTRIBUTE TO SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT OUTCOMES IN GLOBAL ECONOMIC POWER.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (NOVEMBER 2015)ONE WAY TO UNWIND MASS INCARCERATION WITHOUT COMPROMISING PUBLIC SAFETY IS TO USE RISK ASSESSMENT INSTRUMENTS IN SENTENCING AND CORRECTIONS. THESE INSTRUMENTS FIGURE PROMINENTLY IN CURRENT REFORMS, BUT CONTROVERSY HAS BEGUN TO SWIRL AROUND THEIR USE. THE PRINCIPAL CONCERN IS THAT BENEFITS IN CRIME CONTROL WILL BE OFFSET BY COSTS IN SOCIAL JUSTICE — A DISPARATE AND ADVERSE EFFECT ON RACIAL MINORITIES AND THE POOR. BASED ON A SAMPLE OF 34,794 FEDERAL OFFENDERS, WE EMPIRICALLY EXAMINE THE RELATIONSHIPS AMONG RACE (BLACK VS. WHITE), ACTUARIAL RISK ASSESSMENT (THE POST CONVICTION RISK ASSESSMENT [PCRA]), AND RE-ARREST (FOR ANY/VIOLENT CRIME). FIRST, APPLICATION OF WELL-ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLES OF PSYCHOLOGICAL SCIENCE REVEALED NO REAL EVIDENCE OF TEST BIAS FOR THE PCRA — THE INSTRUMENT STRONGLY PREDICTS RE-ARREST FOR BOTH BLACK AND WHITE OFFENDERS AND A GIVEN SCORE HAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME MEANING — I.E., SAME PROBABILITY OF RECIDIVISM — ACROSS GROUPS. SECOND, BLACK OFFENDERS OBTAIN MODESTLY HIGHER AVERAGE SCORES ON THE PCRA THAN WHITE OFFENDERS (D = .43; APPX. 27% NON-OVERLAP IN GROUPS’ SCORES). SO SOME APPLICATIONS OF THE PCRA COULD CREATE DISPARATE IMPACT — WHICH IS DEFINED BY MORAL RATHER THAN EMPIRICAL CRITERIA. THIRD, MOST (69%) OF THE RACIAL DIFFERENCE IN PCRA SCORES IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CRIMINAL HISTORY — WHICH STRONGLY PREDICTS RECIDIVISM FOR BOTH GROUPS AND IS EMBEDDED IN SENTENCING GUIDELINES. FINALLY, CRIMINAL HISTORY IS NOT A PROXY FOR RACE — INSTEAD, IT FULLY MEDIATES THE OTHERWISE WEAK RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN RACE AND RE-ARREST. DATA MAY BE MORE HELPFUL THAN RHETORIC, IF THE GOAL IS TO IMPROVE PRACTICE AT THIS OPPORTUNE MOMENT IN HISTORY.DOWNLOAD

AND KENNEALY, PATRICK AND MONAHAN, JOHN AND PETERSON, JILLIAN AND APPELBAUM, PAUL S., ""PSYCHOSIS UNCOMMONLY AND INCONSISTENTLY PRECEDES VIOLENCE AMONG HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS"" (SEPTEMBER 22, 2015). A SMALL GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS IS REPEATEDLY INVOLVED IN VIOLENCE. LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW OFTEN AND HOW CONSISTENTLY THESE HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCE DELUSIONS OR HALLUCINATIONS JUST BEFORE A VIOLENT INCIDENT. TO ADDRESS THESE QUESTIONS, DATA FROM THE MACARTHUR VIOLENCE RISK ASSESSMENT STUDY WAS USED TO IDENTIFY 305 VIOLENT INCIDENTS ASSOCIATED WITH 100 FORMER INPATIENTS WITH REPEATED VIOLENCE (REPRESENTING 50% OF INCIDENTS AND 9% OF PARTICIPANTS), AND TEST WHETHER PSYCHOSIS-PRECEDED INCIDENTS CLUSTER WITHIN INDIVIDUALS. RESULTS INDICATED THAT (A) PSYCHOSIS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDED 12% OF INCIDENTS, (B) INDIVIDUALS WERE “FAIRLY” CONSISTENT IN THEIR VIOLENCE TYPE (ICC = .42), AND (C) THOSE WITH EXCLUSIVELY “NON-PSYCHOSIS-PRECEDED” VIOLENCE (80%) COULD BE DISTINGUISHED FROM A SMALL GROUP WHO ALSO HAD SOME PSYCHOSIS-PRECEDED VIOLENCE (20%). THESE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT PSYCHOSIS SOMETIMES FORESHADOWS VIOLENCE FOR A FRACTION OF HIGH-RISK INDIVIDUALS, BUT VIOLENCE PREVENTION EFFORTS SHOULD ALSO TARGET FACTORS LIKE ANGER CONTROL AND SOCIAL DEVIANCE.MONAHAN, JOHN AND SKEEM, JENNIFER L., RISK ASSESSMENT IN CRIMINAL SENTENCING (SEPTEMBER 17, 2015). ANNUAL REVIEW OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY, FORTHCOMING; VIRGINIA PUBLIC LAW AND LEGAL THEORY RESEARCH PAPER, NO. 53. THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE SEEN A SURGE OF INTEREST IN USING RISK ASSESSMENT IN CRIMINAL SENTENCING, BOTH TO REDUCE RECIDIVISM BY INCAPACITATING OR TREATING HIGH-RISK OFFENDERS AND TO REDUCE PRISON POPULATIONS BY DIVERTING LOW-RISK OFFENDERS FROM PRISON. WE BEGIN BY SKETCHING JURISPRUDENTIAL THEORIES OF SENTENCING, DISTINGUISHING THOSE THAT RELY ON RISK ASSESSMENT FROM THOSE THAT PRECLUDE IT. WE THEN CHARACTERIZE AND ILLUSTRATE THE VARYING ROLES THAT RISK ASSESSMENT MAY PLAY IN THE SENTENCING PROCESS. WE CLARIFY QUESTIONS REGARDING THE VARIOUS MEANINGS OF “RISK” IN SENTENCING AND THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO ASSESS THE RISK OF CONVICTED OFFENDERS. WE CONCLUDE BY ADDRESSING FOUR PRINCIPAL PROBLEMS CONFRONTING RISK ASSESSMENT IN SENTENCING: CONFLATING RISK AND BLAME, BARRING INDIVIDUAL INFERENCES BASED ON GROUP DATA, FAILING ADEQUATELY TO DISTINGUISH RISK ASSESSMENT FROM RISK REDUCTION, AND IGNORING WHETHER, AND IF SO, HOW, THE USE OF RISK ASSESSMENT IN SENTENCING AFFECTS RACIAL AND ECONOMIC DISPARITIES IN IMPRISONMENT.DOWNLOAD

ANNUAL REVIEW OF CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGY, FORTHCOMING; COLUMBIA PUBLIC LAW RESEARCH PAPER NO. 14-375.AFTER A DISTINCTLY PUNITIVE ERA, A PERIOD OF REMARKABLE REFORM IN JUVENILE CRIME REGULATION HAS BEGUN. PRACTICAL URGENCY HAS FUELED INTEREST IN BOTH CRIME REDUCTION AND RESEARCH ON THE PREDICTION AND MALLEABILITY OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. IN THIS RAPIDLY CHANGING CONTEXT, HIGH-RISK YOUTH - THE SMALL PROPORTION OF THE POPULATION WHERE CRIME IS CONCENTRATED - PRESENT A CONUNDRUM. RESEARCH INDICATES THAT THESE ARE PRECISELY THE INDIVIDUALS TO INTENSIVELY TREAT TO MAXIMIZE CRIME REDUCTION, BUT THERE ARE BOTH REAL AND IMAGINED BARRIERS TO DOING SO. INSTITUTIONAL PLACEMENT OR CRIMINAL COURT PROCESSING CAN EXCLUDE THESE YOUTHS FROM INTERVENTIONS THAT WOULD BETTER PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE SYNTHESIZE RELEVANT RESEARCH TO HELP RESOLVE THIS CHALLENGE IN A MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW’S CORE PRINCIPLES. IN OUR VIEW, ADOLESCENCE OFFERS UNIQUE OPPORTUNITIES FOR RISK REDUCTION THAT COULD (WITH MODIFICATIONS) BE REALIZED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM IN COOPERATION WITH OTHER SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS.DOWNLOAD

WE BELIEVE THAT THESE GROUP-BASED INSTRUMENTS ARE USEFUL FOR ASSESSING AN INDIVIDUAL’S RISK, AND THAT AN INSTRUMENT SHOULD BE CHOSEN BASED ON AN EVALUATION’S PURPOSE (I.E., RISK ASSESSMENT VS.

					WORKING PAPER (MAY 2019)I INVESTIGATE MEDIUM- AND LONG-TERM IMPACTS OF THE GREAT RECESSION ON POST-RECESSION COLLEGE GRADUATES. MOST SO-CALLED “SCARRING” MODELS EMPHASIZE EFFECTS OF INITIAL CONDITIONS THAT ATTENUATE OVER THE FIRST DECADE OF A WORKER’S CAREER. BUT EARLY CAREER RECESSIONS MAY ALSO HAVE PERMANENT EFFECTS. I DECOMPOSE THE RECENT COHORTS’ EXPERIENCE INTO TRANSITORY TIME EFFECTS, MEDIUM-TERM SCARRING, AND PERMANENT COHORT EFFECTS. COHORT EFFECTS ARE STRONGLY CYCLICAL. MEDIUM-TERM SCARRING EXPLAINS ONLY HALF OF THIS CYCLICALITY. THE LONG-RUN CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE RECESSION ON GRADUATES’ EMPLOYMENT IS MORE THAN TWICE AS LARGE AS THE IMMEDIATE EFFECT.DOWNLOAD

DIFFERENCES AMONG CZS IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PARENTAL INCOME AND CHILDREN’S HUMAN CAPITAL EXPLAIN ONLY ONE-NINTH OF THE VARIATION IN INCOME TRANSMISSION. A SIMILAR SHARE IS EXPLAINED BY DIFFERENCES IN THE RETURN TO HUMAN CAPITAL. ONE-THIRD REFLECTS EARNINGS DIFFERENCES NOT MEDIATED BY HUMAN CAPITAL, AND 40% REFLECTS DIFFERENCES IN MARRIAGE PATTERNS. INTERGENERATIONAL MOBILITY APPEARS TO REFLECT JOB NETWORKS AND THE STRUCTURE OF LOCAL LABOR AND MARRIAGE MARKETS MORE THAN IT DOES THE EDUCATION SYSTEM.

					WORKING PAPER (NOVEMBER 2018)THE SYNTHETIC CONTROL METHOD (SCM) IS A POPULAR APPROACH FOR ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF A TREATMENT ON A SINGLE UNIT IN PANEL DATA SETTINGS. THE “SYNTHETIC CONTROL” IS A WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF CONTROL UNITS THAT BALANCES THE TREATED UNIT’S PRE-TREATMENT OUTCOMES AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE. THE CURSE OF DIMENSIONALITY, HOWEVER, MEANS THAT SCM DOES NOT GENERALLY ACHIEVE EXACT BALANCE, WHICH CAN BIAS THE SCM ESTIMATE. WE PROPOSE AN EXTENSION, AUGMENTED SCM, WHICH USES AN OUTCOME MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE BIAS DUE TO COVARIATE IMBALANCE AND THEN DE-BIASES THE ORIGINAL SCM ESTIMATE, ANALOGOUS TO BIAS CORRECTION FOR INEXACT MATCHING. WE MOTIVATE THIS APPROACH BY SHOWING THAT SCM IS A (REGULARIZED) INVERSE PROPENSITY SCORE WEIGHTING ESTIMATOR, WITH PRE-TREATMENT OUTCOMES AS COVARIATES AND A RIDGE PENALTY ON THE PROPENSITY SCORE COEFFICIENTS. WE GIVE THEORETICAL GUARANTEES FOR SPECIFIC CASES AND PROPOSE A NEW INFERENCE PROCEDURE. WE DEMONSTRATE GAINS FROM AUGMENTED SCM WITH EXTENSIVE SIMULATION STUDIES AND APPLY THIS FRAMEWORK TO CANONICAL SCM EXAMPLES. WE IMPLEMENT THE PROPOSED METHOD IN THE NEW AUGSYNTH R PACKAGE.DOWNLOAD

NEVERTHELESS, AN ESTIMATED ONE-FIFTH OF ELIGIBLE HOUSEHOLDS DO NOT CLAIM IT. WE RAN SIX PRE-REGISTERED, LARGE-SCALE FIELD EXPERIMENTS TO TEST WHETHER “NUDGES” COULD INCREASE EITC TAKE-UP (N=1MILLION).

A FEATURE OF ADVANCED ECONOMIES THAT DISTINGUISHES THEM FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS THE EXISTENCE OF WELL DEVELOPED, IF OFTEN INCOMPLETE, SAFETY NETS. WE DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR DESCRIBING TRANSFER PROGRAMS, FLEXIBLE ENOUGH TO ENCOMPASS MOST EXISTING PROGRAMS AS WELL AS UBIS, AND USE THIS FRAMEWORK TO COMPARE VARIOUS UBIS TO THE EXISTING CONSTELLATION OF PROGRAMS IN THE UNITED STATES. A UBI WOULD DIRECT MUCH LARGER SHARES OF TRANSFERS TO CHILDLESS, NON-ELDERLY, NON-DISABLED HOUSEHOLDS THAN EXISTING PROGRAMS, AND MUCH MORE TO MIDDLE-INCOME RATHER THAN POOR HOUSEHOLDS. A UBI LARGE ENOUGH TO INCREASE TRANSFERS TO LOW-INCOME FAMILIES WOULD BE ENORMOUSLY EXPENSIVE. WE REVIEW THE LABOR SUPPLY LITERATURE FOR EVIDENCE ON THE LIKELY IMPACTS OF A UBI. WE ARGUE THAT THE ONGOING UBI PILOT STUDIES WILL DO LITTLE TO RESOLVE THE MAJOR OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS.DOWNLOAD

RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT IT ALSO REDUCES POVERTY AND IMPROVES HEALTH AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES. THE MAXIMUM CREDIT FOR FAMILIES WITH TWO OR FEWER CHILDREN HAS REMAINED FLAT IN INFLATION-ADJUSTED TERMS SINCE 1996. OVER THE SAME PERIOD, EARNINGS PROSPECTS HAVE STAGNATED OR DIMINISHED FOR MANY AMERICANS, AND PRIME-AGE EMPLOYMENT RATES HAVE FALLEN. THIS PAPER PROPOSES TO BUILD ON THE SUCCESSES OF THE EITC WITH A TEN PERCENT ACROSSTHE-BOARD INCREASE IN THE FEDERAL CREDIT. THIS EXPANSION WOULD PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL OFFSET TO STAGNATING REAL WAGES, ENCOURAGE MORE PEOPLE TO ENTER EMPLOYMENT, LIFT APPROXIMATELY 600,000 INDIVIDUALS OUT OF POVERTY, AND IMPROVE HEALTH AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES FOR MILLIONS OF CHILDREN.DOWNLOAD

FOR THE AVERAGE EXHAUSTEE, THE LOSS OF UI BENEFITS IS ONLY SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PARTICIPATION IN OTHER SAFETY NET PROGRAMS (E.G., FOOD STAMPS), AND FAMILY POVERTY RATES RISE SUBSTANTIALLY. SELF‐REPORTED DISABILITY ALSO RISES FOLLOWING UI EXHAUSTION.

(JOINT WITH JESSE ROTHSTEIN)IN THIS PAPER, WE REVIEW THE MOST PROMINENT PROVISION OF THE FEDERAL INCOME TAX CODE THAT TARGETS LOW-INCOME TAX FILERS, THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT (EITC), AS WELL AS THE STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR CHILD TAX CREDIT (CTC). WE FRAME THE PAPER AROUND WHAT WE SEE AS THE PROGRAMS’ GOALS: DISTRIBUTIONAL, PROMOTING WORK, AND LIMITING ADMINISTRATIVE AND COMPLIANCE COSTS. WE REVIEW WHAT IS KNOWN ABOUT PROGRAM IMPACTS AND DISTRIBUTIONAL CONSEQUENCES UNDER CURRENT LAW, DRAWING ON SIMULATIONS FROM THE TAX POLICY CENTER.

2017. IN HANDBOOK OF FIELD EXPERIMENTS, VOL. 2, ABHIJIT BANERJEE AND ESTHER DUFLO, EDS. NORTH HOLLAND.LARGE-SCALE SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS WERE PIONEERED IN LABOR ECONOMICS, AND ARE THE BASIS FOR MUCH OF WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TOPICS RANGING FROM THE EFFECT OF JOB TRAINING TO INCENTIVES FOR JOB SEARCH TO LABOR SUPPLY RESPONSES TO TAXATION. RANDOM ASSIGNMENT HAS PROVIDED A POWERFUL SOLUTION TO SELECTION PROBLEMS THAT BEDEVIL NON-EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH. NEVERTHELESS, MANY IMPORTANT QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE TOPICS REQUIRE GOING BEYOND RANDOM ASSIGNMENT. THIS APPLIES TO QUESTIONS PERTAINING TO BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL VALIDITY, AND INCLUDES EFFECTS ON ENDOGENOUSLY OBSERVED OUTCOMES, SUCH AS WAGES AND HOURS; SPILLOVER EFFECTS; SITE EFFECTS; HETEROGENEITY IN TREATMENT EFFECTS; MULTIPLE AND HIDDEN TREATMENTS; AND THE MECHANISMS PRODUCING TREATMENT EFFECTS. IN THIS CHAPTER, WE REVIEW THE VALUE AND LIMITATIONS OF RANDOMIZED SOCIAL EXPERIMENTS IN THE LABOR MARKET, WITH AN EMPHASIS ON THESE DESIGN ISSUES AND APPROACHES TO ADDRESSING THEM. THESE APPROACHES EXPAND THE RANGE OF QUESTIONS THAT CAN BE ANSWERED USING EXPERIMENTS BY COMBINING EXPERIMENTAL VARIATION WITH ECONOMETRIC OR THEORETICAL ASSUMPTIONS. WE ALSO DISCUSS EFFORTS TO BUILD THE MEANS OF ANSWERING THESE TYPES OF QUESTIONS INTO THE EX ANTE DESIGN OF EXPERIMENTS. OUR DISCUSSION YIELDS AN OVERVIEW OF THE EXPANDING TOOLKIT AVAILABLE TO EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHERS.DOWNLOAD

THESE SCORES REFLECT NONTRIVIAL DECISIONS ABOUT HOW TO MEASURE AND SCALE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR SECONDARY ANALYSES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SCORES COMPUTED IN SEVERAL MAJOR TESTING REGIMES, INCLUDING THE NATIONAL ASSESSMENT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS (NAEP), DEPEND NOT ONLY ON THE EXAMINEES’ RESPONSES TO TEST ITEMS, BUT ALSO ON THEIR BACKGROUND CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING RACE AND GENDER. AS A CONSEQUENCE, IF A BLACK AND WHITE STUDENT RESPOND IDENTICALLY TO QUESTIONS ON THE NAEP ASSESSMENT, THE REPORTED ABILITY FOR THE BLACK STUDENT WILL BE LOWER THAN FOR THE WHITE STUDENT—REFLECTING THE LOWER AVERAGE PERFORMANCE OF BLACK STUDENTS. THIS CAN BIAS MANY SECONDARY ANALYSES. OTHER ASSESSMENTS USE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT MODELS. THIS PAPER AIMS TO FAMILIARIZE APPLIED ECONOMISTS WITH THE CONSTRUCTION AND PROPERTIES OF COMMON COGNITIVE SCORE MEASURES AND THE IMPLICATIONS FOR RESEARCH USING THESE MEASURES.DOWNLOAD

	MORE THAN 2 YEARS AFTER THE OFFICIAL END OF THE GREAT RECESSION, THE LABOR MARKET REMAINS HISTORICALLY WEAK. ONE CANDIDATE EXPLANATION IS SUPPLY-SIDE EFFECTS DRIVEN BY DRAMATIC EXPANSIONS OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE (UI) BENEFIT DURATIONS, TO AS LONG AS 99 WEEKS. THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EFFECT OF THESE EXTENSIONS ON JOB SEARCH AND REEMPLOYMENT. I USE THE LONGITUDINAL STRUCTURE OF THE CURRENT POPULATION SURVEY TO CONSTRUCT UNEMPLOYMENT EXIT HAZARDS THAT VARY ACROSS STATES, OVER TIME, AND BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS WITH DIFFERING UNEMPLOYMENT DURATIONS. I THEN USE THESE HAZARDS TO EXPLORE A VARIETY OF COMPARISONS INTENDED TO DISTINGUISH THE EFFECTS OF UI EXTENSIONS FROM OTHER DETERMINANTS OF EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. THE VARIOUS SPECIFICATIONS YIELD QUITE SIMILAR RESULTS. UI EXTENSIONS HAD SIGNIFICANT BUT SMALL NEGATIVE EFFECTS ON THE PROBABILITY THAT THE ELIGIBLE UNEMPLOYED WOULD EXIT UNEMPLOYMENT. THESE EFFECTS ARE CONCENTRATED AMONG THE LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYED. THE ESTIMATES IMPLY THAT UI EXTENSIONS RAISED THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN EARLY 2011 BY ONLY ABOUT 0.1 TO 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINT, MUCH LESS THAN IMPLIED BY PREVIOUS ANALYSES, WITH AT LEAST HALF OF THIS EFFECT ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED LABOR FORCE EXIT AMONG THE UNEMPLOYED RATHER THAN TO THE CHANGES IN REEMPLOYMENT RATES THAT ARE OF GREATER POLICY CONCERN.DOWNLOAD

	IN THE EARLY 2000S, A HIGHLY SELECTIVE UNIVERSITY INTRODUCED A “NO-LOANS” POLICY UNDER WHICH THE LOAN COMPONENT OF FINANCIAL AID AWARDS WAS REPLACED WITH GRANTS. WE USE THIS NATURAL EXPERIMENT TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL EFFECT OF STUDENT DEBT ON EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. IN THE STANDARD LIFE-CYCLE MODEL, YOUNG PEOPLE MAKE OPTIMAL EDUCATIONAL INVESTMENT DECISIONS IF THEY ARE ABLE TO FINANCE THESE INVESTMENTS BY BORROWING AGAINST FUTURE EARNINGS; THE PRESENCE OF DEBT HAS ONLY INCOME EFFECTS ON INVESTMENT DECISIONS. WE FIND THAT DEBT CAUSES GRADUATES TO CHOOSE SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER-SALARY JOBS AND REDUCES THE PROBABILITY THAT STUDENTS CHOOSE LOW-PAID “PUBLIC INTEREST” JOBS. WE ALSO FIND SOME EVIDENCE THAT DEBT AFFECTS STUDENTS' ACADEMIC DECISIONS DURING COLLEGE. OUR ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES ARE NOT LIFE-CYCLE AGENTS. TWO POTENTIAL EXPLANATIONS ARE THAT YOUNG WORKERS ARE CREDIT CONSTRAINED OR THAT THEY ARE AVERSE TO HOLDING DEBT. WE FIND SUGGESTIVE EVIDENCE THAT DEBT REDUCES STUDENTS' DONATIONS TO THE INSTITUTION IN THE YEARS AFTER THEY GRADUATE AND INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A GRADUATE WILL DEFAULT ON A PLEDGE MADE DURING HER SENIOR YEAR; WE ARGUE THIS RESULT IS MORE LIKELY CONSISTENT WITH CREDIT CONSTRAINTS THAN WITH DEBT AVERSION.

	THE EITC IS INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE WORK. BUT EITC-INDUCED INCREASES IN LABOR SUPPLY MAY DRIVE WAGES DOWN. I SIMULATE THE ECONOMIC INCIDENCE OF THE EITC. IN EACH SCENARIO THAT I CONSIDER, A LARGE PORTION OF LOW-INCOME SINGLE MOTHERS’ EITC PAYMENTS IS CAPTURED BY EMPLOYERS THROUGH REDUCED WAGES. WORKERS WHO ARE EITC INELIGIBLE ALSO SEE WAGE DECLINES. BY CONTRAST, A TRADITIONAL NEGATIVE INCOME TAX (NIT) DISCOURAGES WORK, AND SO INDUCES LARGE TRANSFERS FROM EMPLOYERS TO THEIR WORKERS. WITH MY PREFERRED PARAMETERS, $1 IN EITC SPENDING INCREASES AFTER-TAX INCOMES BY $0.73, WHILE $1 SPENT ON THE NIT YIELDS $1.39.ROTHSTEIN, JESSE WITH STEPHANIE CELLINI AND FERNANDO FERREIRA.

ABOUT ITS ECONOMIC RETURN. IN THIS PAPER, WE ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF SCHOOL FACILITY
INVESTMENTS USING HOUSING MARKETS: STANDARD MODELS OF LOCAL PUBLIC GOODS IMPLY
THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS SHOULD SPEND UP TO THE POINT WHERE MARGINAL INCREASES WOULD
HAVE ZERO EFFECT ON LOCAL HOUSING PRICES. OUR RESEARCH DESIGN ISOLATES EXOGENOUS
VARIATION IN INVESTMENTS BY COMPARING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHERE REFERENDA ON BOND
ISSUES TARGETED TO FUND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES PASSED AND FAILED BY NARROW MARGINS. WE EXTEND THIS TRADITIONAL REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY APPROACH TO IDENTIFY THE DYNAMIC TREATMENT EFFECTS OF BOND AUTHORIZATION ON LOCAL HOUSING PRICES, STUDENT
ACHIEVEMENT, AND DISTRICT COMPOSITION. OUR RESULTS INDICATE THAT CALIFORNIA SCHOOL
DISTRICTS UNDERINVEST IN SCHOOL FACILITIES: PASSING A REFERENDUM CAUSES IMMEDIATE, SIZABLE INCREASES IN HOME PRICES, IMPLYING A WILLINGNESS TO PAY ON THE PART OF MARGINAL HOMEBUYERS OF $1.50 OR MORE FOR EACH $1 OF CAPITAL SPENDING. THESE
EFFECTS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN THE INCOME OR RACIAL COMPOSITION OF
HOMEOWNERS, AND THE IMPACT ON TEST SCORES APPEARS TO EXPLAIN ONLY A SMALL PORTION

LED TO PROPOSALS TO REWARD GOOD TEACHERS AND PENALIZE (OR FIRE) BAD ONES. THE
LEADING METHOD FOR ASSESSING TEACHER QUALITY IS “VALUE ADDED” MODELING (VAM),
WHICH DECOMPOSES STUDENTS’ TEST SCORES INTO COMPONENTS ATTRIBUTED TO STUDENT
HETEROGENEITY AND TO TEACHER QUALITY. IMPLICIT IN THE VAM APPROACH ARE STRONG
ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE NATURE OF THE EDUCATIONAL PRODUCTION FUNCTION AND THE
ASSIGNMENT OF STUDENTS TO CLASSROOMS. IN THIS PAPER, I DEVELOP FALSIFICATION TESTS
FOR THREE WIDELY USED VAM SPECIFICATIONS, BASED ON THE IDEA THAT FUTURE TEACHERS
CANNOT INFLUENCE STUDENTS’ PAST ACHIEVEMENT. IN DATA FROM NORTH CAROLINA, EACH
OF THE VAMS’ EXCLUSION RESTRICTIONS IS DRAMATICALLY VIOLATED. IN PARTICULAR, THESE
MODELS INDICATE LARGE “EFFECTS” OF FIFTH GRADE TEACHERS ON FOURTH GRADE TEST SCORE
GAINS. I ALSO FIND THAT CONVENTIONAL MEASURES OF INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS’ VALUE ADDED
FADE OUT VERY QUICKLY AND ARE AT BEST WEAKLY RELATED TO LONG-RUN EFFECTS. I DISCUSS
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE USE OF VAMS AS PERSONNEL TOOLS.

	NONRANDOM ASSIGNMENT OF STUDENTS TO TEACHERS CAN BIAS VALUE-ADDED ESTIMATES OF TEACHERS’ CAUSAL EFFECTS. ROTHSTEIN (2008, 2010) SHOWS THAT TYPICAL VALUE-ADDED MODELS INDICATE LARGE COUNTERFACTUAL EFFECTS OF FIFTHGRADE TEACHERS ON STUDENTS’ FOURTH-GRADE LEARNING, INDICATING THAT CLASSROOM ASSIGNMENTS ARE FAR FROM RANDOM.THIS ARTICLE QUANTIFIES THE RESULTING BIASES IN ESTIMATES OF FIFTH-GRADE TEACHERS’ CAUSAL EFFECTS FROM SEVERAL VALUEADDED MODELS, UNDER VARYING ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT PROCESS. IF ASSIGNMENTS ARE ASSUMED TO DEPEND ONLY ON OBSERVABLES, THE MOST COMMONLY USED SPECIFICATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO IMPORTANT BIAS, BUT OTHER FEASIBLE SPECIFICATIONS ARE NEARLY FREE OF BIAS. I ALSO CONSIDER THE CASE IN WHICH ASSIGNMENTS DEPEND ON UNOBSERVED VARIABLES. I USE THE ACROSS-CLASSROOM VARIANCE OF OBSERVABLES TO CALIBRATE SEVERAL MODELS OF THE SORTING PROCESS. RESULTS INDICATE THAT EVEN THE BEST FEASIBLE VALUE-ADDED MODELS MAY BE SUBSTANTIALLY BIASED, WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE BIAS DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AVAILABLE FOR USE IN CLASSROOM ASSIGNMENTS.

	DATA FROM COLLEGE ADMISSIONS TESTS CAN PROVIDE A VALUABLE MEASURE OF STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT, BUT THE NON-REPRESENTATIVENESS OF TEST-TAKERS IS AN IMPORTANT CONCERN. WE EXAMINE SELECTIVITY BIAS IN BOTH STATE-LEVEL AND SCHOOL-LEVEL SAT AND ACT AVERAGES. THE DEGREE OF SELECTIVITY MAY DIFFER IMPORTANTLY ACROSS AND WITHIN SCHOOLS, AND ACROSS AND WITHIN STATES. TO IDENTIFY WITHIN-STATE SELECTIVITY, WE USE A CONTROL FUNCTION APPROACH THAT CONDITIONS ON SCORES FROM A REPRESENTATIVE TEST. ESTIMATES INDICATE STRONG SELECTIVITY OF TEST-TAKERS IN “ACT STATES,” WHERE MOST COLLEGE-BOUND STUDENTS TAKE THE ACT, AND MUCH LESS SELECTIVITY IN SAT STATES. TO IDENTIFY WITHIN- AND BETWEEN-SCHOOL SELECTIVITY, WE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A POLICY REFORM IN ILLINOIS THAT MADE TAKING THE ACT A GRADUATION REQUIREMENT. ESTIMATES BASED ON THIS POLICY CHANGE INDICATE SUBSTANTIAL POSITIVE SELECTION INTO TEST PARTICIPATION BOTH ACROSS AND WITHIN SCHOOLS. DESPITE THIS, SCHOOL-LEVEL AVERAGES OF OBSERVED SCORES ARE EXTREMELY HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH AVERAGE LATENT SCORES, AS ACROSS-SCHOOL VARIATION IN SAMPLE SELECTIVITY IS SMALL RELATIVE TO THE UNDERLYING SIGNAL. AS A RESULT, IN MOST CONTEXTS THE USE OF OBSERVED SCHOOL MEAN TEST SCORES IN PLACE OF LATENT MEANS UNDERSTATES THE DEGREE OF BETWEEN-SCHOOL VARIATION IN ACHIEVEMENT BUT IS OTHERWISE UNLIKELY TO LEAD TO MISLEADING CONCLUSIONS.ROTHSTEIN, JESSE WITH ALBERT YOON. UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO LAW REVIEW 75(2), SPRING 2008, PP. 649-714.THE SUPREME COURT HAS HELD REPEATEDLY THAT RACE-BASED PREFERENCES IN PUBLIC UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS ARE CONSTITUTIONAL. BUT DEBATES OVER THE WISDOM OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION CONTINUE. OPPONENTS OF THESE POLICIES ARGUE THAT PREFERENCES ARE DETRIMENTAL TO MINORITY STUDENTS -- THAT BY PLACING THESE STUDENTS IN ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE TOO COMPETITIVE, AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HURTS THEIR ACADEMIC AND CAREER OUTCOMES.THIS ARTICLE EXAMINES THE SO-CALLED ""MISMATCH"" HYPOTHESIS IN THE CONTEXT OF LAW SCHOOL ADMISSIONS. WE DISCUSS THE EXISTING SCHOLARSHIP ON MISMATCH, IDENTIFYING METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATIONS OF EARLIER ATTEMPTS TO MEASURE THE EFFECTS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. USING A SIMPLER, MORE ROBUST ANALYTICAL STRATEGY, WE FIND THAT THE DATA ARE INCONSISTENT WITH LARGE MISMATCH EFFECTS, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO EMPLOYMENT OUTCOMES. WHILE MODERATE MISMATCH EFFECTS ARE POSSIBLE, THEY ARE CONCENTRATED AMONG THE STUDENTS WITH THE WEAKEST ENTERING ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS.TO PUT OUR ESTIMATES IN CONTEXT, WE SIMULATE ADMISSIONS UNDER RACE-BLIND RULES. ELIMINATING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF BLACK LAW STUDENTS, PARTICULARLY AT THE MOST SELECTIVE SCHOOLS. MANY POTENTIALLY SUCCESSFUL BLACK LAW STUDENTS WOULD BE EXCLUDED, FAR MORE THAN THE NUMBER WHO WOULD BE INDUCED TO PASS THE BAR EXAM BY THE ELIMINATION OF MISMATCH EFFECTS. ACCORDINGLY, WE FIND THAT ELIMINATING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WOULD DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE PRODUCTION OF BLACK LAWYERS.DOWNLOAD

WE USE REGRESSION DISCONTINUITY METHODS AND CENSUS TRACT DATA FROM 1970 THROUGH 2000 TO TEST FOR DISCONTINUITIES IN THE DYNAMICS OF NEIGHBORHOOD RACIAL COMPOSITION. WE FIND STRONG EVIDENCE THAT WHITE POPULATION FLOWS EXHIBIT TIPPING-LIKE BEHAVIOR IN MOST CITIES, WITH A DISTRIBUTION OF TIPPING POINTS RANGING FROM 5% TO 20% MINORITY SHARE. TIPPING IS PREVALENT BOTH IN THE SUBURBS AND NEAR EXISTING MINORITY ENCLAVES. IN CONTRAST TO WHITE POPULATION FLOWS, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE OF NONLINEARITIES IN RENTS OR HOUSING PRICES AROUND THE TIPPING POINT. TIPPING POINTS ARE HIGHER IN CITIES WHERE WHITES HAVE MORE TOLERANT RACIAL ATTITUDES.

	RACIAL SEGREGATION IS OFTEN BLAMED FOR SOME OF THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP BETWEEN BLACKS AND WHITES. WE STUDY THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL AND NEIGHBORHOOD SEGREGATION ON THE RELATIVE SAT SCORES OF BLACK STUDENTS ACROSS DIFFERENT METROPOLITAN AREAS, USING LARGE MICRODATA SAMPLES FOR THE 1998–2001 TEST COHORTS. OUR MODELS INCLUDE DETAILED CONTROLS FOR THE FAMILY BACKGROUND OF INDIVIDUAL TEST-TAKERS, SCHOOL-LEVEL CONTROLS FOR SELECTIVE PARTICIPATION IN THE TEST, AND CITY-LEVEL CONTROLS FOR RACIAL COMPOSITION, INCOME, AND REGION. WE FIND ROBUST EVIDENCE THAT THE BLACK–WHITE TEST SCORE GAP IS HIGHER IN MORE SEGREGATED CITIES. HOLDING CONSTANT FAMILY BACKGROUND AND OTHER FACTORS, A SHIFT FROM A HIGHLY SEGREGATED CITY TO A NEARLY INTEGRATED CITY CLOSES ABOUT ONE-QUARTER OF THE RAW BLACK–WHITE GAP IN SAT SCORES. SPECIFICATIONS THAT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN SCHOOL AND NEIGHBORHOOD SEGREGATION SUGGEST THAT NEIGHBORHOOD SEGREGATION HAS A CONSISTENTLY NEGATIVE IMPACT WHILE SCHOOL SEGREGATION HAS NO INDEPENDENT EFFECT, THOUGH WE CANNOT REJECT EQUALITY OF THE TWO EFFECTS. ADDITIONAL TESTS INDICATE THAT MUCH OF THE EFFECT OF NEIGHBORHOOD SEGREGATION OPERATES THROUGH NEIGHBORS' INCOMES, NOT THROUGH RACE PER SE. DATA ON ENROLLMENT IN HONORS COURSES SUGGEST THAT WITHIN-SCHOOL SEGREGATION INCREASES WHEN SCHOOLS ARE MORE HIGHLY INTEGRATED, POTENTIALLY OFFSETTING THE BENEFITS OF SCHOOL DESEGREGATION AND ACCOUNTING FOR OUR FINDINGS.

	SCHOOL CHOICE POLICIES MAY, BY ALIGNING ADMINISTRATORS’ INCENTIVES WITH PARENTAL DEMAND, YIELD IMPROVED EFFICIENCY IN EDUCATIONAL PRODUCTION (MILTON FRIEDMAN, 1962; JOHN E. CHUBB AND TERRY M. MOE, 1990). BUT ERIC A. HANUSHEK (1981) CAUTIONS: “IF THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS IS DUE TO POOR INCENTIVES FOR TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS COUPLED WITH POOR DECISION-MAKING BY CONSUMERS, IT WOULD BE UNWISE TO EXPECT MUCH FROM PROGRAMS THAT SEEK TO STRENGTHEN ‘MARKET FORCES’ IN THE SELECTION OF SCHOOLS” (P. 35, EMPHASIS ADDED). POOR DECISION-MAKING IS NOT REQUIRED; PARENTS MAY RATIONALLY CHOOSE SCHOOLS WITH “PLEASANT SURROUNDINGS, ATHLETIC FACILITIES, CULTURAL ADVANTAGES” (IBID., P. 34) OVER THOSE THAT MOST EFFICIENTLY PURSUE ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE; THEY MAY PREFER POORLY RUN SCHOOLS WITH GOOD PEER GROUPS OVER THOSE THAT ARE MORE EFFECTIVE BUT ENROLL WORSE STUDENTS (J. DOUGLAS WILLMS AND FRANK H. ECHOLS, 1992, 1993); OR THEY MAY SIMPLY BE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY EFFECTIVE SCHOOLS (THOMAS J. KANE AND DOUGLAS O. STAIGER, 2002). ANY FACTOR THAT LEADS PARENTS TO CHOOSE ANY BUT THE MOST EFFECTIVE AVAILABLE SCHOOLS WILL TEND TO DILUTE THE INCENTIVES FOR EFFICIENT MANAGEMENT THAT CHOICE MIGHT OTHERWISE CREATE.
	THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE DISTRIBUTION OF STUDENT OUTCOMES ACROSS SCHOOLS WITHIN METROPOLITAN HOUSING MARKETS FOR EVIDENCE ON PARENTAL DEMAND. ECONOMISTS HAVE LONG NOTED THAT PARENTS’ CHOICES AMONG RESIDENTIAL LOCATIONS ARE POTENTIALLY INFORMATIVE ABOUT HOW MORE COMPLETE CHOICE SYSTEMS MAY OPERATE (CHARLES M. TIEBOUT, 1956; MELVIN V. BORLAND AND ROY M. HOWSEN, 1992; CAROLINE M. HOXBY, 2000; ROTHSTEIN, 2005). I ASK WHETHER SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS PLAYS A SUFFICIENTLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN THESE DECISIONS TO CREATE MEANINGFUL INCENTIVES FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE SCHOOL MANAGEMENT.ROTHSTEIN, JESSE WITH ALAN KRUEGER AND SARAH TURNER.

WE PROJECT THE TEST SCORE DISTRIBUTION OF BLACK AND WHITE COLLEGE APPLICANTS 25 YEARS FROM NOW, FOCUSING ON THE ROLE OF BLACK–WHITE FAMILY INCOME GAPS. ECONOMIC PROGRESS ALONE IS UNLIKELY TO NARROW THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP ENOUGH IN 25 YEARS TO PRODUCE TODAY’S RACIAL DIVERSITY LEVELS WITH RACE-BLIND ADMISSIONS. A RETURN TO THE RAPID BLACK–WHITE TEST SCORE CONVERGENCE OF THE 1980S COULD PLAUSIBLY CAUSE BLACK REPRESENTATION TO APPROACH CURRENT LEVELS AT MODERATELY SELECTIVE SCHOOLS, BUT NOT AT THE MOST SELECTIVE SCHOOLS.
ROTHSTEIN, JESSE WITH ALAN KRUEGER AND SARAH TURNER. IN COLLEGE ACCESS: OPPORTUNITY OR PRIVILEGE, MICHAEL MCPHERSON AND MORTON SCHAPIRO, EDS, NEW YORK: THE COLLEGE BOARD, 2006, PP. 35-46.
IN HER OPINION IN GRUTTER V. BOLLINGER, JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O’CONNOR CONCLUDED THAT AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN COLLEGE ADMISSIONS IS JUSTIFIABLE, BUT NOT IN PERPETUITY: “WE EXPECT THAT 25 YEARS FROM NOW, THE USE OF RACIAL PREFERENCES WILL NO LONGER BE NECESSARY TO FURTHER THE INTEREST [IN STUDENT BODY DIVERSITY] APPROVED TODAY.”
	THE RATE AT WHICH RACIAL GAPS IN PRECOLLEGIATE ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT CAN PLAUSIBLY BE EXPECTED TO ERODE IS A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY. IN THIS ESSAY, WE ATTEMPT TO EVALUATE THE PLAUSIBILITY OF JUSTICE O’CONNOR’S CONJECTURE BY PROJECTING THE RACIAL COMPOSITION OF THE 2025 ELITE COLLEGE APPLICANT POOL. OUR PROJECTIONS EXTRAPOLATE PAST TRENDS ON TWO IMPORTANT MARGINS: GAPS BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC RESOURCES OF BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS’ FAMILIES, AND NARROWING OF TEST SCORE GAPS BETWEEN BLACK AND WHITE STUDENTS WITH SIMILAR FAMILY INCOMES. JUST AS THE LAST DECADES HAVE SEEN CONSIDERABLE NARROWING OF GAPS ON EACH MARGIN, FURTHER PROGRESS CAN BE EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT QUARTER CENTURY.
	OUR CENTRAL QUESTION IS WHETHER THIS PROGRESS WILL PLAUSIBLY BE FAST ENOUGH TO VALIDATE JUSTICE O’CONNOR’S PREDICTION. WE ARE WELL AWARE OF THE HAZARDS INHERENT IN OUR EXERCISE: NO SUCH DISTANT PROJECTIONS CAN BE DEFINITIVE. NEVERTHELESS, BY RELYING ON REASONABLE HISTORICAL ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE ARGUABLY OPTIMISTIC, WE DEVELOP A BASELINE CASE FOR ASSESSING THE LIKELIHOOD OF O’CONNOR’S FORECAST.
WE CONCLUDE THAT UNDER REASONABLE ASSUMPTIONS, AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBSTANTIALLY UNDERREPRESENTED AMONG THE MOST QUALIFIED COLLEGE APPLICANTS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE MAGNITUDE OF THE UNDERREPRESENTATION IS LIKELY TO SHRINK—IN OUR MOST OPTIMISTIC SIMULATION, SOMEWHAT OVER HALF OF THE GAP THAT WOULD BE OPENED BY THE ELIMINATION OF RACE PREFERENCES WILL BE CLOSED BY THE PROJECTED IMPROVEMENT IN BLACK ACHIEVEMENT.
	STILL, IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT TODAY’S LEVEL OF RACIAL DIVERSITY WILL BE ACHIEVABLE WITHOUT SOME FORM OF CONTINUING AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. IF THE SUPREME COURT FOLLOWS THROUGH WITH O’CONNOR’S STATED INTENTION TO BAN AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN 25 YEARS, AND IF COLLEGES DO NOT ADJUST IN OTHER WAYS (SUCH AS REDUCING THE IMPORTANCE OF NUMERICAL QUALIFICATIONS TO ADMISSIONS), WE PROJECT SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES IN THE REPRESENTATION OF AFRICAN AMERICANS AMONG ADMITTED STUDENTS AT SELECTIVE INSTITUTIONS.
	OUR ANALYSIS PROCEEDS FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE MOST LIKELY FUTURE COURSE WILL RESEMBLE PAST TRENDS. SUBSTANTIAL CHANGES IN EDUCATIONAL POLICY, IN SCHOOL EFFECTIVENESS, AND IN INCOME INEQUALITY WOULD ALL HAVE IMPORTANT EFFECTS ON BLACK TEST SCORE DISTRIBUTIONS AND ON THE ADMISSIONS LANDSCAPE.

DOUGLASS PRESENTS A MAJOR COMPARATIVE EXPLORATION OF THE ROLE OF NATIONAL POLITICS AND NORMS IN SHAPING THE ROLE OF UNIVERSITIES IN NATION-STATES—AND VICE VERSA. HE ALSO EXPLORES WHEN UNIVERSITIES ARE SOCIETAL LEADERS OR FOLLOWERS: WHEN THEY ARE AGENTS OF SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE, OR SIMPLY AGENTS REINFORCING AND SUPPORTING AN EXISTING SOCIAL AND POLITICAL ORDER. IN A SERIES OF CASE STUDIES, DOUGLASS AND CONTRIBUTORS EXAMINE TROUBLING TRENDS THAT THREATEN THE SOCIETAL ROLE OF UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING ATTACKS ON CIVIL LIBERTIES, FREE SPEECH, AND THE VALIDITY OF SCIENCE; THE FIRING AND JAILING OF ACADEMICS; ANTI-IMMIGRANT RHETORIC; AND RESTRICTIONS ON VISAS WITH CONSEQUENCES FOR THE MOBILITY OF ACADEMIC TALENT. THE BOOK ALSO OFFERS RECOMMENDATIONS TO PRESERVE THE AUTONOMY AND ACADEMIC FREEDOM OF UNIVERSITIES AND THEIR CONSTITUENTS. NEO-NATIONALISM AND UNIVERSITIES IS WRITTEN FOR A BROAD PUBLIC READERSHIP INTERESTED AND CONCERNED ABOUT THE RISE OF NATIONALIST MOVEMENTS, ILLIBERAL DEMOCRACIES, AND AUTOCRATIC LEADERS.DOWNLOAD 
									BOOK LAUNCH EVENT CONCEPTUALIZING THE MODERN AMERICAN PUBLIC UNIVERSITY: EARLY DEBATES OVER UTILITARIANISM, AUTONOMY, AND ADMISSIONS. JOHN AUBREY DOUGLASS, CSHE 8.21 (JULY 2021), CSHE RESEARCH AND OCCASIONAL PAPERS SERIES (ROPS), 2021IN THE DISCOURSE THAT SWIRLED IN THE MID-1800S AROUND THE CREATION OF NEW AMERICAN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES, THREE MAJOR AND INTERRELATED TENSIONS BECAME EVIDENT: THE FIRST RELATED TO THE CONTINUED DEBATE REGARDING THE PROPER CURRICULAR BALANCE BETWEEN PRACTICAL EDUCATION AND CLASSICAL STUDIES; THE SECOND FOCUSED ON THE APPROPRIATE AUTONOMY OF INSTITUTIONS INTENDED TO SERVE THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN A SOCIETY OFTEN RACKED BY SECTARIAN AND CLASS CONFLICT; AND THE THIRD CENTERED ON THE DEGREE TO WHICH THESE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE SELECTIVE IN THEIR ADMISSIONS AND REPRESENTATIVE OF THE STATE’S POPULATION. REFLECTING THE DIVERSITY OF CULTURAL AND POLITICAL DIFFERENCES OF THE STATES, A VARIETY OF ORGANIZATIONAL APPROACHES COULD BE FOUND IN MID-CENTURY AMERICA. HOWEVER, BY THE 1870S, A DISTINCT PATH DID EMERGE, INFLUENCED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE LAND-GRANT COLLEGE ACT OF 1862. THE ACT FORCED STATES TO MORE ACTIVELY DEFINE THE CHARACTER OF THEIR STATE EDUCATION SYSTEMS AND THE PURPOSE OF THEIR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. THE ORIGINS AND EARLY DEVELOPMENT OF A STATE UNIVERSITY IN MICHIGAN OFFERS AN INFORMATIVE WINDOW INTO EACH OF THESE TENSIONS. THE RESPONSES OFFERED BY MICHIGAN SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE RISE OF THE AMERICAN PUBLIC UNIVERSITY, AND THE CHARACTER OF ITS SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITIES.DOWNLOAD

IN THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE, FACULTY POSITIONS ARE EXTREMELY LIMITED; MOST DOCTORAL DEGREE RECIPIENTS FIND JOBS AND CAREERS OUTSIDE OF ACADEMIA. BASED ON SURVEY DATA GENERATED BY THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE IN THE RESEARCH UNI-VERSITY (SERU) CONSORTIUM, WE CAN LOOK AT GRADUATE STUDENT’S RESPONSES BOTH BE-FORE AND DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THEIR RESPONSES PROVIDE GUIDEPOSTS FOR UNIVERSITY LEADERS TO ASSESS WAYS TO IMPROVE THEIR TEACHING AND RESEARCH ACTIVITIES. WE CAN ALSO EXPLORE THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN AMERICAN/CANADIAN UNIVERSITIES AND A SELECTED GROUP OF EUROPEAN UNIVERSITIES.HERE, AND IN OTHER PREVIOUS PUBLICATIONS, WE ARGUE THAT UNIVERSITIES NEED TO SIG-NIFICANTLY REDIRECT AND IMPROVE THEIR INSTITUTIONAL RESEARCH CAPABILITY TO HELP BOOST THEIR MANAGEMENT CAPACITY.DOWNLOAD 
									PDF FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH, THE BAYH-DOLE ACT, AND THE COVID VACCINE RACE. JOHN AUBREY DOUGLASS, CSHE 3.21 (FEBRUARY 2021), CSHE RESEARCH AND OCCASIONAL PAPERS SERIES (ROPS), 2021THIS ESSAY DISCUSSES THE WORLD OF FEDERALLY FUNDED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) BEFORE AND AFTER THE BAYH-DOLE ACT AND ITS IMPACT ON THE WORLD OF SCIENCE AND COMMERCE, BEFORE THEN EXPLORING THE COMPLICATED DEBATES OVER OWNERSHIP OF THE SCIENCE BEHIND THE LIFE-SAVING COVID-19 VACCINES THAT WILL BRING NORMALCY BACK TO THE WORLD. BEFORE 1980, FEDERALLY FUNDED SCIENCE IN THE U.S. WAS LARGELY FOCUSED ON MEETING THE COLD WAR NATIONAL DEFENSE NEEDS OF A NATION IN A SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY RACE WITH THE SOVIET UNION. THE 1980 BAYH-DOLE ACT INITIATED IN EARNEST THE RECOGNITION THAT THE ADVANCEMENT OF NATIONAL ECOSYSTEMS OF SCIENCE WAS ALSO VITAL FOR GLOBAL ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. THE ACT ALLOWED UNIVERSITY GENERATED IP WITH FEDERAL GRANTS TO BE OWNED AND LICENSED BY UNIVERSITIES FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES. BEFORE, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RETAINED OWNERSHIP OF IP. THE RESULT WAS A TRANSFORMATION IN HOW UNIVERSITIES RESEARCHERS VIEWED THE RESEARCH AND IP THEY GENERATED, LEADING TO START-UP COMPANIES AND SUPPORTING A REVOLUTION IN BIOTECH AND OTHER EMERGING AREAS OF SCIENCE. ALTHOUGH MANY RESEARCH-INTENSIVE UNIVERSITIES ALREADY HAD TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER OFFICES, THESE NOW PROLIFERATED. UNIVERSITIES GENERATED POLICIES ON IP OWNERSHIP, INCLUDING A POLICY IN WHICH ANY PROFITS RESULTING FROM PATENTS AND LICENSES ARE SHARED BETWEEN THE RESEARCHER, THE DEPARTMENT OR SCHOOL THEY BELONG TO, AND THE UNIVERSITY. UNIVERSITIES AND OTHER NONPROFITS WERE ALSO REQUIRED TO REINVEST BAYH–DOLE PATENT REVENUES IN SCIENCE RESEARCH AND EDUCATION, GENERATING SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO NEW RESEARCH PROJECTS. BUT THE SUCCESS OF THE BAYH-DOLE ACT, AND THE DISCOVERIES IT HELPED GENERATE, ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO AN INCREASINGLY COMPLICATED WORLD OF IP OWNERSHIP. THE ACT AND SIMILAR LEGISLATION, AS WELL AS FEDERAL FUNDING, CONTRIBUTED TO THE FOUNDATIONAL SCIENCE THAT LED TO THE VARIETY OF COVID-19 VACCINES. ITS PROVISIONS ALSO RAISE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ROLE, AND OWNERSHIP, OF FEDERALLY FUNDED RESEARCH THAT MADE THE VACCINE POSSIBLE. THE NEW BIDEN ADMINISTRATION HAS PUT A PRIORITY ON PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF COVID VACCINES, BUT IT MAY LATER ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THE PRICE AND PROFITS OF PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES UNDER THE “MARCH-IN” RIGHTS RESERVED TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AT THE SAME TIME, THE EMERGENCE OF “VACCINE NATIONALISM,” IN WHICH NATIONS AND DRUG MAKERS PRIORITIZE CONTROL OF IP AND PRODUCTION OF VACCINES FOR THEIR OWN POPULATION, IS TESTING THE ABILITY OF THE WORLD TO EFFECTIVELY RESPOND TO THE VIRUS AS IT MUTATES. IN THE AFTERMATH OF THE COVID PANDEMIC, THE STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OF THE IP WORLD SET OUT BY THE BAYH-DOLE ACT WILL BE DEBATED AND FOCUSED ON TWO QUESTIONS: WHO PROFITED FROM THE PANDEMIC AND AT WHAT GLOBAL PUBLIC EXPENSE?DOWNLOAD 
									PDF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA VERSUS THE SAT: A BRIEF HISTORY AND CONTEMPORARY CRITIQUE. JOHN AUBREY DOUGLASS, CSHE 8.20 (JUNE 2020), CSHE RESEARCH AND OCCASIONAL PAPERS SERIES (ROPS), 2020ON MAY 21, 2020, THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (UC) BOARD OF REGENTS UNANIMOUSLY APPROVED THE SUSPENSION OF THE STANDARDIZED TEST REQUIREMENT (ACT/SAT) FOR ALL CALIFORNIA FRESHMAN APPLICANTS UNTIL FALL 2024. UC PLANS TO CREATE A NEW TEST THAT BETTER ALIGNS WITH THE CONTENT THE UNIVERSITY EXPECTS STUDENTS TO HAVE MASTERED FOR COLLEGE READINESS. HOWEVER, IF A NEW TEST DOES NOT MEET SPECIFIED CRITERIA IN TIME FOR FALL 2025 ADMISSION, UC WILL ELIMINATE THE STANDARDIZED TESTING REQUIREMENT FOR CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THE BOARD’S DECISION IS THE SEEMING CULMINATION OF A 19 YEAR DEBATE OVER THE ROLE OF STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES AT UC. OPPONENTS OF THE WIDESPREAD USE OF THE SAT HAVE LONG CLAIMED THAT THE SAT PROMOTES NEEDLESS SOCIOECONOMIC STRATIFICATION: THE TEST FAVORS STUDENTS FROM UPPER INCOME FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES, IN PART BECAUSE THEY CAN AFFORD A GROWING RANGE OF EXPENSIVE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TEST PREPARATION COURSES AND COUNSELING. THE REGENT’S 2020 DECISION ECHOES THIS VIEW. YET UC HAS AN EVEN LONGER HISTORY OF CONCERN WITH THE STANDARDIZED TESTING. IN FACT, AND AS DISCUSSED IN THIS ESSAY, UC WAS RELATIVELY SLOW IN ADOPTING THE SAT AS A REQUIREMENT IN ADMISSIONS WHEN COMPARED TO OTHER SELECTIVE UNIVERSITIES, PUBLIC OR PRIVATE. THIS PROVIDES THE BASIS FOR A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE CURRENT POLITICS RELATED TO ADMISSIONS AT UC. SETTING ADMISSION POLICY IS NOT SIMPLY THE RESULT OF RATIONAL POLICY SOLUTIONS; THEY ARE, IN SOME FORM, A REFLECTION OF THE INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL POLITICS THAT SHAPE THE POLICY BEHAVIORS OF A UNIVERSITY – PARTICULARLY AT HIGHLY SELECTIVE PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS WITH GREATER LEVELS OF EXPECTED ACCOUNTABILITY AND EXPECTATIONS THAN THEIR PRIVATE COUNTERPARTS. ANOTHER AXIOM THAT IS LARGELY LOST IN THE DEBATES OVER THE USAGE OF TEST SCORES AND A GROWING ARRAY OF ADMISSIONS REQUIREMENTS: SELECTIVE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES MAY ATTEMPT TO CREATE RELATIVELY TRANSPARENT ADMISSIONS CRITERIA, BUT IN THE END MUCH OF THE DECISION-MAKING IS ARBITRARY WHEN CHOOSING AMONG A LARGE POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED CANDIDATES. I THEN OFFER A NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS: FIRST, THAT CHANGES IN ADMISSIONS POLICIES FOCUSED, TO SOME EXTENT, ON EQUITY AND GREATER ACCESS TO UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS MEANS REDISTRIBUTION OF WHAT IS ESSENTIAL A ZERO SUM, ACCESS TO A SELECTIVE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. SECOND, THAT THE PATH TO THE REGENT’S 2020 VOTE IGNORED THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF UC’S ACADEMIC SENATE, DESIGNATED BY THE REGENTS TO SET ADMISSIONS POLICIES. THE SENATE, UC’S REPRESENTATIVE BODY OF THE FACULTY, RECOMMENDED RETAINING THE SAT AND ACT IN SETTING UC ELIGIBILITY POLICIES AND FOR CAMPUS SELECTION OF STUDENTS FOR ADMISSION. THIS RAISES INTERNAL QUESTIONS OF THE PURPOSE AND FUTURE OF SHARED GOVERNANCE.DOWNLOAD 
									PDF SOUTH KOREA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THROUGH CALIFORNIA EYES. JOHN AUBREY DOUGLASS CSHE 4.20 (MAY 2020), CSHE RESEARCH AND OCCASIONAL PAPERS SERIES (ROPS), 2020  LIKE CALIFORNIA, SOUTH KOREA’S SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IS A WORK IN PROGRESS. EACH MUST EVOLVE AND RESHAPE THEMSELVES AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THEIR HISTORIES IN THEIR QUEST FOR RELEVANCY AND, INCREASINGLY, TO EXTERNAL PRESSURES AND DEMANDS OF GOVERNMENTS AND, MORE GENERALLY, SOCIETY. UTILIZING CALIFORNIA’S PIONEERING HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AS A COMPARATIVE LENS, I PROVIDE AN OUTSIDER’S VIEW OF SOUTH KOREA’S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM FROM TWO PERSPECTIVES. FIRST, A NATIONAL SYSTEM VIEWPOINT: HOW IS THE HIGHER EDUCATION ECO-SYSTEM ORGANIZED AND MANAGED, AND WHAT FUNDING AND OTHER INCENTIVES ARE PROVIDED BY THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT? THE SECOND IS AN INSTITUTIONAL VIEWPOINT: WHAT IS THE ACADEMIC AND MANAGEMENT CULTURE OF NATIONAL UNIVERSITIES AND HOW MIGHT THEY SEEK SELF-IMPROVEMENT AND A GREATER IMPACT ON THEIR REGIONAL ROLE? IN PURSUING THIS ANALYSIS, I LEVERAGE MY KNOWLEDGE AND RESEARCH RELATED TO CALIFORNIA’S EFFORTS TO BUILD ITS MASS HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WITH INSTITUTIONS OF HIGH QUALITY AND WORLD PRESTIGE AS WELL AS ASPECTS OF MY NEW FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY MODEL THAT FOCUS ON INSTITUTIONAL SELF-IMPROVEMENT AND MANAGEMENT. TWO GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ARE OFFERED: FIRST, KOREA NEEDS TO REORGANIZE ITS NETWORK OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS; THAT INCLUDES REDUCING THE NUMBER OF PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, WHILE ALSO IMPROVING REGIONAL ROLE AND IMPACT OF ITS PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. SECOND, A MAJOR CHALLENGE FOR KOREA, IN MY VIEW, IS TO DEEMPHASIZE THE RACE FOR RANKINGS AND TO FOCUS MORE ON THE INTERNAL MANAGEMENT CAPACITY OF INSTITUTIONS, AND TO PURSUE A MORE HOLISTIC SOCIETAL ROLE FOR ITS UNIVERSITIES. THE NEW FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY MODEL IS ONE WAY TO EXAMINE THIS ISSUE FOR KOREA.DOWNLOAD 
									PDF BERKELEY VERSUS THE SAT: A REGENT, A CHANCELLOR AND A DEBATE ON THE VALUE OF STANDARDIZED TESTING IN ADMISSIONS. JOHN AUBREY DOUGLASS CSHE 3.19 (JANUARY 2019) CSHE RESEARCH AND OCCASIONAL PAPERS SERIES (ROPS), 2019THE FOLLOWING ESSAY DETAILS A DEBATE BETWEEN UC BERKELEY AND A REGENT WHO MADE CHARGES OF DISCRIMINATION AGAINST ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE CURRENT LEGAL CHALLENGES FACING HARVARD UNIVERSITY. THE CRUX OF SUCH CHARGES: ON AVERAGE, THAT ONE RACIAL OR ETHNIC GROUP IS MORE “QUALIFIED” THAN OTHER GROUPS, OFTEN UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITIES, YET THEY HAVE LOWER ADMISSIONS RATES. IN 2004, REGENT JOHN MOORES, CONVINCED OF DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES TOWARD ASIAN-AMERICAN STUDENTS IN THE ADMISSIONS PROCESS AT BERKELEY, DID HIS OWN ANALYSIS OF UC ADMISSIONS DATA FOCUSED ON SAT SCORES AND THAT HE PUBLICIZED IN THE LA TIMES AND OTHER VENUES. MOORES CLAIMED HIS INVESTIGATION PROVIDED CLEAR EVIDENCE OF DISCRIMINATION. IN THE AFTERMATH OF CALIFORNIA’S PROPOSITION 209 BARRING THE USE OF RACE IN ADMISSIONS, MOORES COMPLAINED THAT BERKELEY’S ADOPTION OF A “HOLISTIC” REVIEW OF APPLICATIONS REDUCED THE IMPORTANCE OF TEST SCORES BY ELEVATING SUBJECTIVE ""MEASUREMENTS"" THAT SERVED AS POSSIBLY ILLEGAL PROXIES FOR RACE AND ETHNICITY. CONJURING MEMORIES OF CHARGES OF DISCRIMINATION IN THE 1980S BY THE ASIAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY REGARDING BERKELEY’S ADMISSIONS PROCESSES, MOORES ASKED, “HOW DID THE UNIVERSITY GET AWAY WITH DISCRIMINATING SO BLATANTLY AGAINST ASIANS?” FOR ANTI-AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ADVOCATES, LIKE MOORES, STANDARDIZED TEST SCORES WERE, AND ARE, SEEN AS THE GOLD STANDARD OF ACADEMIC ABILITY SINCE IT IS A “UNIVERSAL” MEASURE UNLIKE GRADES THAT ARE LOCAL ASSESSMENTS OF ABILITIES AND SUBJECT TO GRADE INFLATION. HOWEVER, WHEN COMPARED TO GRADES IN HIGH SCHOOL, TEST SCORES HAVE PROVEN WEAK INDICATORS OF SUBSEQUENT ACADEMIC SUCCESS AT HIGHLY SELECTIVE UNIVERSITIES THAT MUST CHOOSE AMONG A LARGE POOL OF HIGHLY QUALIFIED STUDENTS. TEST SCORES ALSO ARE NOT NECESSARILY GOOD MEASURES FOR PREDICTING THE FUTURE ENGAGEMENT OF STUDENTS IN THE WIDE RANGE OF EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED BY MAJOR UNIVERSITIES – INCLUDING PUBLIC SERVICE, UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH, AND CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. ANTI-AFFIRMATIVE ACTION ADVOCATES LARGELY SEE ADMISSIONS AS A REWARD BASED ON TEST SCORES AND ARE NOT TERRIBLY CONCERNED WITH THE PREDICTIVE VALIDITY OF OTHER ADMISSIONS CRITERIA. THIS ESSAY CONCLUDES WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE SIMILARITIES OF MOORES’ ANALYSIS AND CHARGE OF DISCRIMINATION IN ADMISSIONS WITH THAT AT HARVARD, AND THE PROBABLE LEGAL PATH TOWARD A NEW SUPREME COURT DECISION ON AFFIRMATIVE ACTION.DOWNLOAD 
									PDF APPROACHING A TIPPING POINT?: A HISTORY AND PROSPECTUS OF FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. JOHN AUBREY DOUGLASS AND ZACHARY BLEEMER, UC CLIOMETRIC HISTORY PROJECT, CENTER FOR STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION, GOLDMAN SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY, AUGUST 2018.2018 MARKS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA’S (UC) 150TH ANNIVERSARY. IN PART TO REFLECT ON THAT HISTORY, AND TO PROVIDE A BASIS TO PEER INTO THE FUTURE, THE FOLLOWING REPORT PROVIDES A HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA’S REVENUE SOURCES AND EXPENDITURES. THE PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE THE UNIVERSITY’S ACADEMIC COMMUNITY, STATE POLICYMAKERS, AND CALIFORNIANS WITH A GREATER UNDERSTANDING OF THE UNIVERSITY’S FINANCIAL HISTORY, FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON THE ESSENTIAL ROLE OF PUBLIC FUNDING.
IN ITS FIRST FOUR DECADES, UC DEPENDED LARGELY ON INCOME GENERATED BY FEDERAL LAND GRANTS AND PRIVATE PHILANTHROPY, AND MARGINALLY ON FUNDING FROM THE STATE. THE YEAR 1911 MARKED A MAJOR TURNING POINT: HENCEFORTH, STATE FUNDING WAS LINKED TO STUDENT ENROLLMENT WORKLOAD. AS A RESULT, THE UNIVERSITY GREW WITH CALIFORNIA’S POPULATION IN ENROLLMENT, ACADEMIC PROGRAMS, AND NEW CAMPUSES. THIS HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO SYSTEMATICALLY FUND UC, THE STATE’S SOLE LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITY, HELPED CREATE WHAT IS NOW CONSIDERED THE WORLD’S PREMIER PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. HOWEVER, BEGINNING WITH CUTBACKS IN THE EARLY 1990S UC’S STATE FUNDING PER STUDENT STEADILY DECLINED. THE PATTERN OF STATE DISINVESTMENT INCREASED MARKEDLY WITH THE ONSET OF THE GREAT RECESSION. AS CHRONICLED IN THIS REPORT, THE UNIVERSITY DIVERSIFIED ITS SOURCES OF INCOME AND ATTEMPTED TO CUT COSTS IN RESPONSE TO THIS PRECIPITOUS DECLINE, WHILE CONTINUING TO ENROLL MORE AND MORE CALIFORNIANS. EVEN WITH THE REMARKABLE IMPROVEMENT IN CALIFORNIA’S ECONOMY, STATE FUNDING PER STUDENT REMAINS SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW WHAT IT WAS ONLY A DECADE AGO. PEERING INTO THE FUTURE, THIS STUDY ALSO PROVIDES A HISTORICALLY INFORMED PROSPECTUS ON THE BUDGET OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO UC. INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES, SUCH AS BERKELEY AND UCLA, MAY BE ABLE TO GENERATE OTHER INCOME SOURCES TO MAINTAIN THEIR QUALITY AND REPUTATION. BUT THERE IS NO CLEAR FUNDING MODEL OR PATHWAY FOR THE SYSTEM TO GROW WITH THE NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. UC MAY BE APPROACHING A TIPPING POINT IN WHICH IT WILL NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER TO CONTINUE TO GROW IN ENROLLMENT WITHOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING, OR LIMIT ENROLLMENT AND PROGRAM GROWTH TO FOCUS ON QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY.DOWNLOAD 
									PDF THIS ESSAY DISCUSSES THE CONTENTIOUS EVENTS LEADING TO THE DECISION BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA’S BOARD OF REGENTS TO END AFFIRMATIVE ACTION IN ADMISSIONS, HIRING AND CONTRACTING AT THE UNIVERSITY IN JULY 1995. THIS CONTROVERSIAL DECISION PROVIDED MOMENTUM FOR CALIFORNIA’S PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION 209 THE FOLLOWING YEAR ENDING “RACIAL PREFERENCES” FOR ALL OF THE STATE’S PUBLIC AGENCIES. IN VIRTUALLY ANY OTHER STATE, THE DEBATE OVER UNIVERSITY ADMISSIONS WOULD HAVE BLED BEYOND THE CONFINES OF A UNIVERSITY’S GOVERNING BOARD. THE BOARD WOULD HAVE DEFERRED TO LAWMAKERS AND AN EVEN MORE COMPLICATED PUBLIC DISCOURSE. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA’S UNUSUAL STATUS AS A “PUBLIC TRUST” UNDER THE STATE CONSTITUTION, HOWEVER, MEANT THAT AUTHORITY OVER ADMISSIONS WAS THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE BOARD. THIS PROVIDED A UNIQUE FORUM TO DEBATE AFFIRMATIVE ACTION FOR KEY ACTORS, INCLUDING REGENT WARD CONNERLY AND GOVERNOR PETE WILSON, TO PERSUADE FELLOW REGENTS TO FOCUS AND DECIDE ON A HOTLY DEBATED SOCIAL ISSUE RELATED TO THE DISPERSAL OF A HIGHLY SOUGHT PUBLIC GOOD – ACCESS TO A SELECTIVE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY. TWO THEMES ARE EXPLORED.

THE UNITED STATES COULD HAVE SUSTAINED THAT DOMINANCE, ESSENTIALLY DIFFERING TO THE PRIVATE SECTOR IN EXPANDING ACCESS, AND DELAYING THE “RISE OF THE PUBLICS.” THIS DID NOT HAPPEN. A MAJOR TURNING POINT CAME IN THE MID-1800S. PRIVATE COLLEGES SEEMED INCAPABLE OR SIMPLY NOT INTERESTED IN SERVING THE BROADER NEEDS OF AMERICAN SOCIETY. INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA, AND THE NEW STATE UNIVERSITIES IN MICHIGAN, WISCONSIN, AND MINNESOTA, OFFERED THE FIRST EXAMPLES OF A NEW INSTITUTIONAL BREED. EACH WAS BORNE OUT OF PUBLIC DEBATES REGARDING THE PURPOSE OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN A NEW NATION, INCLUDING THE INITIAL IDEA OF A FEDERAL UNIVERSITY. OUT OF THIS EARLY PERIOD OF INSTITUTION BUILDING CAME IMPORTANT IDEAS ON THE POTENT ROLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN SHAPING THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT, INTIMATELY LINKED WITH REVOLUTIONARY IDEAS ON HUMAN ABILITIES AND THE REQUIREMENTS FOR CREATING A FUNCTIONING, PARTICIPATORY DEMOCRACY. BY THE MID-1800, STATE GOVERNMENTS, WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PROMPTING, LAUNCHED A DRAMATIC NUMBER OF NEW PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES DISTINCT IN THEIR GOVERNANCE, IN THEIR COMMITMENT TO BROAD ACCESS, IN THE SCOPE OF THEIR ACADEMIC PROGRAMS, AND IN THEIR COMMITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE. THIS ESSAY EXPLORES THESE DEBATES AND HOW THEY INFLUENCED INSTITUTION BUILDING, WITH A FOCUS ON THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BY AN ACT OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE – THE 1868 ORGANIC ACT. IN ITS STATED PURPOSE, GOVERNANCE, AND PLANNED ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS, CALIFORNIA’S LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITY EMBODIED ALL THE ELEMENTS OF THIS NEW BREED OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES WITH THE INTENT OF SHAPING A PROGRESSIVE SOCIETY.THIS YEAR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA CELEBRATES ITS 150 ANNIVERSARY SINCE ESTABLISHMENT IN 1868.  THIS ROPS CONTRIBUTION IS PART OF A SERIES PUBLISHED THIS YEAR BY THE CENTER FOR STUDIES IN HIGHER EDUCATION RELATED TO THE HISTORY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND, MORE BROADLY, AMERICA’S UNIQUE INVESTMENT AND FAITH IN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES.DOWNLOAD

JOHN AUBREY DOUGLASS, CSHE RESEARCH AND OCCASIONAL PAPERS SERIES (ROPS), 2018DESPITE MASSIVE CUTS IN STATE FUNDING OVER THE PAST THIRTY YEARS, THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS MANAGED TO KEEP ENROLLMENT ON PACE WITH GROWTH IN POPULATION.  WITH CALIFORNIA’S POPULATION PROJECTED TO GROW 22.5 PERCENT (FROM 40 TO 49 MILLION BY 2040), THAT WILL NO LONGER BE THE CASE, UNLESS UC IS ABLE TO FIND A NEW FUNDING MODEL. INFORMED BY THE HISTORICAL ANALYSIS IN THE REPORT APPROACHING A TIPPING POINT: A HISTORY AND PROSPECTUS OF FUNDING FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, THIS ESSAY REVISITS THE OPTIONS FOR FUNDING UC FROM THAT REPORT, INCLUDING: REINVESTMENT BY CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS AND A PROPOSED GENERAL BOND MEASURE FOR CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION; INCREASING RESEARCH FUNDING TO HELP SUBSIDIZE TEACHING AND PUBLIC SERVICE PROGRAMS; REVISING THE INDIRECT-COST AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA; RAISING UNDERGRADUATE TUITION AND FEES FOR UPPER INCOME STUDENTS AND ESTABLISHING TUITION PRICING MODEL TIERED BY STUDENT FAMILY INCOME; EXPLORE DIFFERENTIAL FEES BY MAJOR; AND REDUCING THE PERCENTAGE OF UC UNDERGRADUATE TUITION INCOME THAT IS “RETURNED-TO-AID” IN FAVOR OF INCREASED FUNDRAISING FOR FINANCIAL AID. ALL RELATE TO TWO CENTRAL QUESTIONS: A) CAN UC AFFORD TO GROW IN ITS ENROLLMENT AND ACADEMIC PROGRAMS WITH THE STATE’S POPULATION AND NEEDS? AND B) HOW TO IDENTIFY NEW SOURCES OF REVENUE AND PURSUE MANAGEMENT EFFICIENCIES TO REDUCE OPERATING AND CAPITAL COSTS? WITHOUT A SUBSTANTIAL BOOST IN INCOME FROM THE STATE OR OTHER SOURCES, UC MAY BE APPROACHING A CROSSROADS, WHERE IT CONTINUES TO GROW IN ENROLLMENT WITHOUT ADEQUATE FUNDING, OR WHERE IT INSTEAD CHOOSES TO HALT OR LIMIT GROWTH TO FOCUS ON MAINTAINING QUALITY AND PRODUCTIVITY, BUT WITH SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES FOR CALIFORNIA. ANY SIGNIFICANT STATE REINVESTMENT WILL DEPEND ON THE NEW CALIFORNIA GOVERNOR. GOVERNORS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN KEY PLAYERS IN CREATING AND BUILDING CALIFORNIA’S PIONEERING HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM.  A NEW GOVERNOR SHOULD HAVE AMBITIONS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION THAT MATCH THOSE OF CALIFORNIANS. DOWNLOAD 
									PDF THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS NO SIGNIFICANT PLAN OR STRATEGY RELATED TO HIGHER EDUCATION. THE ONLY MAJOR POLICY DECLARATIONS -- TO ELIMINATE FEDERAL REGULATIONS ON FOR-PROFIT COLLEGES AND REVISIT FEDERAL GUIDELINES ON SEXUAL ASSAULT ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES – BOTH UNRAVEL POLICIES DEVELOPED UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. WHERE THE FATE OF HIGHER EDUCATION LIES IS IN THE INNUMERABLE INITIATIVES BENT ON PLEASING TRUMP’S BASE AND IN THE SEARCH FOR SOME SORT OF MAJOR LEGISLATIVE VICTORY. AS OF THIS WRITING, THIS NOW INCLUDES A REPUBLICAN COALITION THAT WANTS TO CUT THE FUNDING FOR MOST FEDERAL AGENCIES TO EASE THE WAY FOR MASSIVE TAX CUTS. IN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION’S INITIAL FEDERAL BUDGET PROPOSAL PRESENTED LAST MAY, TRUMP PLANNED HUGE REDUCTIONS IN FEDERAL PROGRAMS, WITH TWO GLARING EXCEPTIONS: BOOSTING MILITARY SPENDING -- INCLUDING FOR VETERANS BUT ALSO FOR HARDWARE AND MORE TROOPS -- AND FUNDING FOR A CONTINENT STRETCHING BORDER WALL WITH MEXICO. WHAT ABOUT THE FUNDING FUTURE, AND HEALTH AND WELL-BEING, OF AMERICA’S GREAT UNIVERSITIES? TO MAKE FINANCIAL ROOM, AND TO PLACATE SOME ON THE RIGHT, IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE INCREASED OR EVEN STABLE FEDERAL SPENDING FOR RESEARCH AND FINANCIAL AID. TO PARTIALLY OFFSET TAX CUTS, SPENDING MUST COME DOWN, AT LEAST IN A RATIONALE POLICY WORLD. IF THIS SCENARIO PLAYS OUT, HIGHER EDUCATION WILL BE ONE OF MANY CASUALTIES. THEN AGAIN, CONFUSION REGARDING THE TRUMP AGENDA, DISCORD AMONG REPUBLICANS, LOBBYING BY THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS OF THE CURRENT TAX SYSTEM, AND EVEN INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF WHATEVER CONVOLUTED PLAN EMERGES, COULD DERAIL OR SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE TAX-CUT MOMENTUM. OR THE THIRST FOR A LEGISLATIVE TAX-CUT VICTORY MIGHT SIMPLY TEMPORARILY BLIND REPUBLICAN DEFICIT HAWKS. IN THESE SCENARIOS, OR A COMBINATION, FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND FINANCIAL AID MIGHT ONLY SUFFER MINOR CUTS, OR REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE – IN THE SHORT RUN. FOR NOW, MUDDLING THROUGH MIGHT NOT BE GOOD POLICYMAKING, BUT COULD BE THE BEST ONE CAN HOPE FOR. FOR AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE VOLATILE TRUMP ERA, DISASTER AVERTED?DOWNLOAD

SOME SEEM TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT MINISTERIAL EDICT TO HELP OR PUSH THEM TOWARD GREATER SOCIETAL RELEVANCY – OFTEN LIMITED TO IMPROVED GLOBAL RANKINGS. THIS ESSAY DISCUSSES THE EVOLVING IDEA OF THE FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY, ITS PAST AND FUTURE, AND THE NEED TO DEVELOP AND ARTICULATE A MORE HOLISTIC AND MODERN NARRATIVE REGARDING THE ROLE OF THESE IMPORTANT INSTITUTIONS. THE NEW FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY IS AN INSTITUTION GROUNDED IN ITS HISTORICAL PURPOSE, BUT REMARKABLY DIFFERENT IN ITS DEVOTION TO ACCESS AND EQUITY, TO THE QUALITY OF ITS TEACHING, RESEARCH AND PUBLIC SERVICES MISSION, AND TO MEETING NATIONAL AND REGIONAL SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS. THIS PAPER DISCUSSES SOME OF THE CENTRAL THEMES IN THE BOOK, THE NEW FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY, AND INCLUDES OBSERVATIONS IN RECENT ARTICLES BY SCHOLARS AND RESEARCHERS ON THEIR RELEVANCY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD. LEADING NATIONAL OR FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITIES ARE NOW MORE IMPORTANT FOR SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY, FOR KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION, FOR GENERATING ECONOMIC AND CIVIC LEADERS, AND FOR PUSHING INNOVATION AND SOCIETAL SELF-REFLECTION THAN IN ANY OTHER TIME IN THEIR HISTORY. DOWNLOAD

THE UNITED STATES, AND CALIFORNIA IN PARTICULAR, IS VIEWED AS PERHAPS THE MOST ROBUST CREATORS OF KBEAS, PROVIDING AN INFLUENTIAL MODEL THAT IS VISITED AND REVISITED BY BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT LEADERS, AND OTHER FLAGSHIP (OR LEADING NATIONAL) UNIVERSITIES, THAT WISH TO REPLICATE THEIR STRENGTHS WITHIN THEIR OWN CULTURAL AND POLITICAL TERMS.  WHILE CALIFORNIA HAS A NUMBER OF UNIQUE CHARACTERISTICS, INCLUDING A ROBUST UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM WITH A STRONG INTERNAL ACADEMIC CULTURE AND DEVOTION TO PUBLIC SERVICE, THE STORY OF ITS HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY SUCCESS AS AN AGENT OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS CLOSELY LINKED TO A NUMBER OF KEY CONTEXTUAL FACTORS. THESE RELATE TO THE INTERNAL CULTURE, GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT CAPACITY OF MAJOR UNIVERSITIES IN THE UNITED STATES, NATIONAL INVESTMENT PATTERNS IN R&D, THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THE CONCENTRATION OF KNOWLEDGE BASED BUSINESSES, THE ACCEPTANCE OF RISK, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF VENTURE CAPITAL, LEGAL VARIABLES RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP) AND TAX POLICIES, THE QUALITY OF REGIONAL WORKFORCES, AND QUALITY OF LIFE FACTORS THAT ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS FOR ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENT. IN MOST OF THESE KBEAS VARIABLES, CALIFORNIA HAS ENJOYED AN ADVANTAGE THAT HELPS TO PARTIALLY EXPLAIN THE SUCCESS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA (UC) AND OTHER MAJOR RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES AS AGENTS OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON SEVEN CONTEXTUAL VARIABLES COMMON TO ALL KBEAS IN THE UNITED STATES AND MUCH OF THE WORLD, AND WITH PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE UC SYSTEM – A NETWORK OF TEN RESEARCH-INTENSIVE CAMPUSES.DOWNLOAD 
									DOWNLOAD A PDF (368KB)IN AN ERA OF SIGNIFICANT DISINVESTMENT IN PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION BY STATE GOVERNMENTS, MANY PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES ARE MOVING TOWARD A “PROGRESSIVE TUITION MODEL” THAT ATTEMPTS TO INVEST APPROXIMATELY ONE-THIRD OF TUITION INCOME INTO INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID FOR LOWER-INCOME AND MIDDLE-CLASS STUDENTS. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE COST OF TUITION AND KEEP COLLEGE AFFORDABLE. BUT IS THIS MODEL AS CURRENTLY FORMULATED WORKING? WHAT LEVELS OF FINANCIAL STRESS ARE STUDENTS OF ALL INCOME GROUPS EXPERIENCING? AND ARE THEY CHANGING THEIR BEHAVIORS? UTILIZING DATA FROM THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE IN THE RESEARCH UNIVERSITY (SERU) SURVEY OF UNDERGRADUATES AND OTHER DATA SOURCES, THIS STUDY EXPLORES THESE ISSUES BY FOCUSING ON STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND TEN AAU INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE MEMBERS OF THE SERU CONSORTIUM. AT LEAST TO DATE, THE INCREASE IN TUITION, AND COSTS RELATED TO HOUSING AND OTHER LIVING EXPENSES, HAVE NOT HAD A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE NUMBER OF LOWER-INCOME STUDENTS ATTENDING UC. REFLECTING TO SOME DEGREE UC’S ROBUST FINANCIAL AID POLICIES, AND PERHAPS THE GROWING NUMBER OF LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA, THERE HAS BEEN AN ACTUAL INCREASE IN THEIR NUMBER – A COUNTERINTUITIVE FINDING TO THE GENERAL PERCEPTION THAT HIGHER TUITION EQUALS LESS ACCESS TO THE ECONOMICALLY VULNERABLE. AT THE SAME TIME, THERE IS EVIDENCE OF A “MIDDLE-CLASS” SQUEEZE, WITH A MARGINAL DROP IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS FROM THIS ECONOMIC CLASS. STUDENTS’ CONCERNS FOR PAYING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND ACCUMULATED STUDENT DEBT IN THE 2014 SERU ARE PREDICTABLY HIGHER AMONG LOWER-INCOME STUDENTS, YET UPPER-MIDDLE INCOME STUDENTS (WITH ANNUAL FAMILY INCOMES FROM $80–125,000) ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO AGREE THAT THE COST OF ATTENDANCE IS MANAGEABLE. WITH THESE AND OTHER NUANCES AND CAVEATS BRIEFLY DISCUSSED IN THIS STUDY, THE PROGRESSIVE TUITION MODEL APPEARS TO BE WORKING IN TERMS OF AFFORDABILITY AND WITH ONLY MODERATE INDICATORS OF INCREASED FINANCIAL STRESS AND CHANGED STUDENT BEHAVIORS. THESE RESULTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY PREDICTIVE OF THE FUTURE IF TUITION RATES GO UP FURTHER. BUT THEY DO INDICATE THE HIGHER TUITION RATES AT HIGHLY SELECTIVE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES, IF ACCOMPANIED BY ROBUST FEDERAL, STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL FINANCIAL AID, MAY BE THE BEST PATH FOR MAINTAINING ACCESS TO LOWER-INCOME STUDENTS, AND FOR GENERATING INCOME NEEDED FOR INSTITUTIONS TO MAINTAIN OR IMPROVE STUDENT-TO-FACULTY RATIOS AND OTHER MARKERS OF QUALITY. FREEZING TUITION, AS CURRENTLY DEMANDED BY STATE LAWMAKERS IN CALIFORNIA, DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE BASED ON ANY CLEAR ANALYSIS OF THE CORRELATION OF TUITION AND AFFORDABILITY. IT APPEARS MORE AS A POLITICALLY ATTRACTIVE WAY TO APPEAL TO VOTERS WHILE IGNORING THE FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES FOR PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND THE QUALITY OF THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE.DOWNLOAD 
									DOWNLOAD A PDF (2MB)THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BECAME A “PUBLIC TRUST” IN 1879 AS PART OF A LARGER REVISION OF CALIFORNIA’S CONSTITUTION APPROVED BY CALIFORNIA VOTERS. THE UNIVERSITY HENCEFORTH GAINED THE EXCLUSIVE POWER TO OPERATE, CONTROL, AND ADMINISTER THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, BECOMING VIRTUALLY A FOURTH BRANCH OF STATE GOVERNMENT, A ""CONSTITUTIONAL CORPORATION . . . EQUAL AND COORDINATE WITH THE LEGISLATURE, THE JUDICIARY AND THE EXECUTIVE. IT WAS A WATERSHED MOMENT IN THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA’S LAND-GRANT PUBLIC UNIVERSITY, FUNDAMENTALLY SHAPING THE STATE’S SUBSEQUENT DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATIONS, AND THE WORLD’S, FIRST COHERENT APPROACH TO BUILDING A MASS HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. STATUS AS A PUBLIC TRUST SET UC ON A SPECTACULAR COURSE, HELPING IT TO CREATE AN INTERNAL ACADEMIC CULTURE AND DRIVE TO MEET THE SOCIOECONOMIC NEEDS OF THE STATE RELATIVELY FREE OF THE OFTEN CONTENTIOUS POLITICAL INTERVENTIONS FOUND IN MANY OTHER STATES. UC EMERGED AS ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AND PRESTIGIOUS UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD. YET OVER THE PAST SIX OR SO DECADES, THE UNUSUAL STATUS OF THE UNIVERSITY’S GOVERNING BOARD HAS BEEN ON OCCASIONS A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION FOR LAWMAKERS WHO HAVE WANTED TO BE MORE DIRECTLY INVOLVED IN CONTROLLING AND FORMULATING UNIVERSITY POLICY, FROM ADMISSIONS PRACTICES AND TUITION, TO HOW FUNDS ARE RAISED AND SPENT, WHAT ACADEMIC PROGRAMS UC SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT PROVIDE, AND PROPOSALS TO REVISE THE MEMBERSHIP AND AUTHORITY OF THE REGENTS. THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES AN HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF HOW AND WHY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA GAINED THIS UNUSUAL LEVEL OF AUTONOMY. IN ESSENCE, AND IN THE CONTEXT OF 1870S CALIFORNIA, DELEGATES TO THE STATE’S SECOND AND LAST CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IN 1878 HEARD THE COMPLAINTS OF UC’S PRESIDENT DANIEL COIT GILMAN SHORTLY BEFORE HE LEFT IN FRUSTRATION TO BECOME THE HEAD OF JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY, AND CHOSE TO PROTECT IT FROM FURTHER “LEGISLATIVE CONTROL AND POPULAR CLAMOR.” ULTIMATELY, THE DELEGATES AND THE VOTERS CHOSE THE UNIVERSITY’S LAY BOARD WITH A REPRESENTATIVE MIX OF CALIFORNIANS AND LAWMAKERS, THE REGENTS, OVER THE LEGISLATURE AS THE BEST WAY TO ORGANIZE AND PROMOTE UC.DOWNLOAD

									LINK TO PUBLICATION THE ARGUMENT THAT CULTURAL AND OTHER FORMS OF DIVERSITY ENHANCE THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE OF ALL STUDENTS IS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED LARGELY WITH POST-1960 EFFORTS TO EXPAND THE PRESENCE OF DISADVANTAGED GROUPS ON THE CAMPUSES OF AMERICA’S UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES. YET, IN THE CASE OF UC BERKELEY, DEBATES ON THE MERITS OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY HAVE MUCH EARLIER ROOTS IN THE HISTORICAL ENROLLMENT OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. DEBATES IN THE LATE 1800S AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURY REVOLVED AROUND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF ENROLLING FOREIGN STUDENTS, PARTICULARLY THOSE FROM ASIA. THE RESULT WAS AN IMPORTANT INTELLECTUAL DISCUSSION ON THE MERITS OF DIVERSITY THAT WAS EVENTUALLY REFRAMED TO FOCUS LARGELY ON UNDERREPRESENTED DOMESTIC STUDENTS. IN THIS SHORT ESSAY, I DISCUSS HOW THE NOTION OF DIVERSITY, AND ITS EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS, FIRST EMERGED AS A VALUE AT UC BERKELEY. I THEN BRIEFLY DISCUSS THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AT UC BERKELEY AND OTHER PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. THUS FAR, THE PRIMARY IMPETUS OF THIS INCREASE HAS BEEN MOSTLY FINANCIAL—BERKELEY HAS FACED SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC DISINVESTMENT, SEEKS NEW REVENUE SOURCES, AND CAN CHARGE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS TUITION RATES SIMILAR TO ELITE PRIVATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. BY TARGETING 20 PERCENT OF ALL UNDERGRADUATES AS INTERNATIONAL OR OUT-OF-STATE (US-RESIDENT NON-CALIFORNIANS)—THE MAJORITY INTERNATIONAL—THE BERKELEY CAMPUS IS ESSENTIALLY DIVERSIFYING ITS STUDENT BODY. HOW DOES HAVING MORE GLOBALLY INCLUSIVE ENROLLMENT FIT INTO OUR CONTEMPORARY IDEAS OF DIVERSITY? I ATTEMPT A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THIS QUESTION AND THE POLICY CHALLENGES GENERATED BY THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS AT THE UNDERGRADUATE LEVEL AT BERKELEY AND OTHER UC CAMPUSES, INCLUDING ACCESS FOR CALIFORNIANS.DOWNLOAD

THIS MACRO MANAGEMENT AND MAJOR MODIFICATION IN UC’S HISTORICAL SOCIAL CONTRACT WITH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA CONFRONTS THE NEW PRESIDENT, JANET NAPOLITANO, AND, MORE GENERALLY, THE UC ACADEMIC COMMUNITY AND CALIFORNIANS. ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, THERE ARE SIGNS OF AN IMPROVED ECONOMY AS WELL AS A GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE DEALING WITH FUNDAMENTAL BUDGET ISSUES, SUCH AS BETTER CONTROLLING PUBLIC PENSIONS AND REDUCING EXORBITANT INCARCERATION RATES. IF CALIFORNIA, UNDER A REVISED MASTER PLAN, FLOATS TOWARD AN ATTEMPT TO RECREATE A SUITABLE FUNDING AND ORGANIZATIONAL MODEL FOR PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION, NAPOLITANO IS POTENTIALLY A POWERFUL POLITICAL FIGURE WHO COULD HELP DRIVE IT TO A SUCCESSFUL CONCLUSION.

									DOWNLOAD A PDF (319KB)BOLSTERED BY THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE 1998 BOYER REPORT, US FEDERAL AGENCIES HAVE PUT SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES INTO PROMOTING OPPORTUNITIES FOR UNDERGRADUATES TO ENGAGE IN RESEARCH. AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES HAVE BEEN CREATING SUPPORT PROGRAMS AND CURRICULAR OPPORTUNITIES INTENDED TO CREATE A “CULTURE OF UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH.” YET OUR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE COMMONALITY OF UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH ENGAGEMENT—HOW IT INTEGRATES INTO THE EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE, AND ITS BENEFITS OR LACK THEREOF—IS STILL VERY LIMITED. UNIVERSITIES EXUDE THE IDEAL OF A PIVOTAL LINK OF TEACHING AND RESEARCH. WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT PERSONAL INTERACTIONS BETWEEN ACTIVE SCHOLARS AND UNDERGRADUATES—VIA TRADITIONAL CURRICULUM, RESEARCH COURSES, WORKING IN A LAB OR DOING FIELDWORK—HAVE POSITIVE INFLUENCES ON STUDENTS’ MATURATION AND THEIR OVERALL ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL EXPERIENCE. THE FOLLOWING EXPLORATORY STUDY LOOKS AT DATA GENERATED BY THE 2010 STUDENT EXPERIENCE IN THE RESEARCH UNIVERSITY (SERU) UNDERGRADUATE SURVEY, AN ONLINE CENSUS ADMINISTERED AT FIFTEEN MAJOR RESEARCH-INTENSIVE UNIVERSITIES. AMONG THIS SPECIFIC CASE STUDY OF MOSTLY AAU CAMPUSES, THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH ENGAGEMENT OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL CLASSROOM IS A RELATIVELY COMMON EXPERIENCE. FURTHER, THIS RESEARCH ENGAGEMENT LEADS TO SELF-REPORTED LEARNING GAINS ACROSS MANY AREAS, BUT ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF FIELD KNOWLEDGE, HOW TO PRESENT AND COMMUNICATE KNOWLEDGE, RESEARCH SKILLS, HIGHER LEVELS OF SATISFACTION ABOUT EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCES, BETTER USE OF TIME, AND HIGHER LEVELS OF NON-QUANTITATIVE SKILLS. YET NOT ALL RESEARCH ACTIVITIES ARE CREATED EQUALLY. THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF RESEARCH: THOSE RESEARCH ACTIVITIES THAT MAINLY INVOLVE ASSISTING FACULTY RESEARCH, AND THOSE THAT MAINLY INVOLVE CONDUCTING INDEPENDENT PERSONAL RESEARCH. THE FORMER IS MORE PREVALENT IN STEM FIELDS, WHILE THE LATTER IS MORE LIKELY IN THE HUMANITIES, SOCIAL SCIENCES, AND IN PROFESSIONAL MAJORS. FURTHER, LOWER-DIVISION STUDENTS ALSO TEND TO PARTICIPATE IN ASSISTING FACULTY RESEARCH MORE OFTEN THAN THEIR UPPER-DIVISION PEERS, WHO ARE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN INDEPENDENT RESEARCH. AS PART OF THE ONGOING SERU RESEARCH AGENDA, WE HOPE TO GENERATE A MORE EXTENSIVE ANALYSIS OF SERU DATA AND OTHER DATA SOURCES. WE SUGGEST THAT SERU CAMPUSES CONSIDER AMENDING THEIR CURRENT CURRICULAR REQUIREMENTS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATIONS RESULTING FROM THIS INVESTIGATION: 1. USE THE SERU DATABASE TO PROVIDE REGULAR REPORTS ON UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH ENGAGEMENT, AND INCLUDE THOSE REPORTS IN ACADEMIC PROGRAM/DEPARTMENT REVIEWS; 2. EXPAND EXISTING EFFORTS SO THAT MOST, IF NOT ALL, UNDERGRADUATES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TWO OR MORE NON-CLASSROOM FORMS OF RESEARCH ENGAGEMENT, PERHAPS DEPENDING ON THE FIELD OF THE MAJOR AND DISCIPLINE.DOWNLOAD

									LINK TO PUBLICATION ONCE AGAIN, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT WILL DECIDE ON THE CONTENTIOUS ISSUE OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, AND SPECIFICALLY THE USE OF RACE IN ADMISSIONS DECISIONS IN PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. DESPITE DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS, SEASONED VETERANS OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION DEBATES ARE EXPERIENCING DÉJÀ VU. IN THIS CASE, ABIGAIL NOEL FISHER CLAIMS OVERT RACIAL DISCRIMINATION WHEN THE HIGHLY SELECTIVE UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN (UT) REJECTED HER FRESHMAN APPLICATION IN 2008. THE COURT’S RULING COULD RANGE FROM UPHOLDING THE LEGAL PRECEDENT OF ALLOWING RACE TO BE ONE OF MANY FACTORS IN ADMISSIONS; TO A MORE NARROW DECISION THAT REJECTS UT’S PARTICULAR USE OF RACE, BUT SETS NEW LIMITS ON SUCH DECISIONS; TO AN OUTRIGHT REJECTION OF USING RACE IN ANY FORM AS ONE AMONG MANY FACTORS UNIVERSITIES CURRENTLY USE IN ADMISSIONS. IN THIS PAPER, I DISCUSS THE CASE AND PRESENT A NUMBER OF THEMES THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE COURT AND BY THE PUBLIC, INCLUDING PROBLEMS WITH THE NOTION OF A “CRITICAL MASS” OF MINORITY STUDENTS; THAT ARGUMENTS REGARDING ACADEMIC MERIT ARE COMPLEX AND NUANCED; AND THAT AMONG HIGHLY SELECTIVE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES, WHERE DEMAND FROM MANY QUALIFIED STUDENTS FAR EXCEEDS THE SUPPLY OF ADMISSIONS SPOTS, ADMISSIONS POLICIES HAVE ARBITRARY OUTCOMES DESPITE THE BEST EFFORTS TO CREATE RATIONAL AND EXPLAINABLE ADMISSIONS POLICIES. AS MUCH AS ANYTHING, THE FISHER CASE IS ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE LOCUS OF ADMISSIONS POLICY AND DECISIONS. THE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT, AS REITERATED BY JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O’CONNER IN THE 2003 GRUTTER CASE, IS THAT JUDGMENTS RELATED TO THE QUESTION OF ADMISSIONS, INCLUDING THE IDEA OF SUFFICIENT CRITICAL MASS OF UNDERREPRESENTED STUDENTS AND FACTORS THAT INDICATE FUTURE ACADEMIC SUCCESS, ARE, IN THE END, JUDGMENTS THAT SHOULD REMAIN WITHIN THE ACADEMY AND WHICH THE COURTS SHOULD NOT INFRINGE ON WITHOUT A COMPELLING NEED TO DO SO. THERE IS NO COMPELLING NEED IN THE FISHER CASE. SIMPLY AGREEING TO HEAR THE CASE SEEMS TO INDICATE A WILLINGNESS BY THE COURT TO OVERRULE PAST PRECEDENT. YET THERE IS ALSO A POSSIBILITY THAT THE COURT’S DECISION WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THE PROSPECT THAT A RULING AGAINST AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WILL, FOR THE FIRST TIME, HAVE MEANING FOR SELECTIVE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, WHICH HAVE LARGELY AVOIDED SCRUTINY OF THEIR ADMISSIONS PRACTICES AND BIASES. AS ALL OF THE JUSTICES ARE PRODUCTS OF EASTERN ELITE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, THIS COULD BE AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION, ALTHOUGH SPECULATIVE.DOWNLOAD

THE TAXONOMY IS ORGANIZED UTILIZING THE CONCEPTS OF ACTIVITY CLUSTERS, MODES OF ENGAGEMENT, AND INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS. ITS PURPOSE IS TO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR FUTURE RESEARCH AS WELL AS A TOOL FOR SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS TO BETTER ANALYZE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT HAS BECOME A RUSH BY MANY UNIVERSITIES TO BECOME MORE ENGAGED GLOBALLY. AFTER A BRIEF DISCUSSION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF CONTEXTUAL VARIABLES SUCH AS ACADEMIC DISCIPLINE, ACADEMIC PROGRAM LEVEL, AND THE PRESTIGE HIERARCHY, THE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE UNIVERSITY AS A SOCIAL ORGANIZATION ARE CONSIDERED. A CENTRAL ASSUMPTION IS THAT THE MOST MEANINGFUL AND SUCCESSFUL CHANGE IN THE UNIVERSITY OCCURS WHEN THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF THE ORGANIZATION AND THE SIGNIFICANT FORMAL AND INFORMAL AUTHORITY OF FACULTY AND ACADEMIC STAFF IS RECOGNIZED AND INCORPORATED INTO DECISION PROCESSES IN REAL AND MEANINGFUL WAYS. THE TAXONOMY OF ACTIONS AND LOGICS IS CONCEPTUALIZED AS A LIST OF MODES OF ENGAGEMENT THAT CAN BE ORGANIZED INTO SEVEN CLUSTERS OF ACTIVITY. CLUSTERS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL FACULTY INITIATIVES; THE MANAGEMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL DEMOGRAPHY; MOBILITY INITIATIVES; CURRICULAR AND PEDAGOGICAL CHANGE; TRANSNATIONAL INSTITUTIONAL ENGAGEMENTS; NETWORK BUILDING; AND CAMPUS CULTURE, ETHOS, AND LEADERSHIP. NINE INSTITUTIONAL LOGICS ARE DESCRIBED AND PROPOSED AS POSSIBLE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES AS TO HOW UNIVERSITIES INTERPRET THEIR GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT AND JUSTIFY STRATEGIES, POLICIES, AND ACTIONS THEY UNDERTAKE. INTERNATIONAL AND GLOBAL REALITIES HAVE BECOME A CENTRAL STRATEGIC CONCERN FOR MANY UNIVERSITIES. THE FRAMEWORK OFFERED IN THIS ARTICLE IS INTENDED TO HELP SUPPORT EMPIRICAL RESEARCH ON STRATEGIES, ACTIONS AND LOGICS AT THE INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL AND AN ON-GOING RESEARCH PROJECT BY THE AUTHORS.DOWNLOAD 
									DOWNLOAD A PDF (234KB)IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD WAR ERA, AMERICA’S RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES BECAME INCREASINGLY CHARACTERIZED BY A TRIBAL MENTALITY AMONG SCHOOLS AND DEPARTMENTS, AND DISCIPLINES. THE SURGE IN RESEARCH FUNDING, AND THE TREMENDOUS GROWTH RATE AMONG THE MAJOR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES IN PARTICULAR, FOSTERED THE IDEA OF THE “MULTIVERSITY” WAS BECOMING LESS COMMUNAL, AND LESS AWARE OF THE COLLECTIVE PURPOSE. THESE PATTERNS HAVE ACCELERATED CONSIDERABLY OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES IN THE US THAT REFLECT THREE RELATIVELY NEW REALITIES OR INFLUENCES: A) WITHIN THE PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SECTOR, DECREASING PUBLIC SUBSIDIES HAVE INFLUENCED A MOVEMENT TOWARD INTERNAL MANAGEMENT DECISIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE ERODED A PREVIOUS MODEL OF REVENUE SHARING (IN TUITION AND FEES, IN OVERHEAD GENERATED BY EXTRAMURAL RESEARCH, FOR EXAMPLE) TO PROFIT, LOSS, AND PRESTIGE CENTERS; B) THIS HAS BEEN ACCOMPANIED AND REINFORCED BY THE CONCEPT THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT MARKET OPPORTUNITIES AMONG DIFFERENT SCHOOLS, DEPARTMENTS, DISCIPLINES AND THEIR DEGREES, AND HENCE OPPORTUNITY COSTS (IN THE TUITION PRICE OF AN MBA VERSUS AND ENGLISH PHD, FOR EXAMPLE) IN WHICH HIGH INCOME UNITS SHOULD RETAIN AND SPEND THOSE MONIES. THESE INFLUENCES ARE COMMON IN VARIOUS DEGREES GLOBALLY BUT FROM DIFFERENT SOURCE. IN MUCH OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING EUROPE, THE DEMANDS AND EDICTS OF MINISTRIES AND EVOLVING CONCEPTS OF FACULTY AS CIVIL SERVANTS HEAVILY INFLUENCE ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR. IN THE US, THE DECREASE IN PUBLIC INVESTMENT IS DRIVING INTERNAL BEHAVIORS SHAPED AS WELL BY THE INTERESTS OF FACULTY, THE INCREASING GLOBAL NATURE OF KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTION, AND MARKET OPPORTUNITIES THAT DIFFER AMONG THE DISCIPLINES. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPACT OF THESE VARIOUS INFLUENCES ON RESEARCH INTENSIVE UNIVERSITIES, WITH THE THEME THAT THE INTERNAL CONCEPT OF THE UNIVERSITY IS RAPIDLY CHANGING, INFLUENCING THE BEHAVIOR OF ACADEMIC LEADERS AND FACULTY, THE ORGANIZATION OF THE POST-MODERN UNIVERSITY, THE FLOW OF FUNDS, AND ULTIMATELY THE PERCEIVED AND REAL ROLE OF THE RESEARCH UNIVERSITY IN SOCIETY. PAST OBSERVERS OF THE LIFE AND TIMES ON UNIVERSITIES HAVE DESCRIBED ASPECTS OF THIS SHIFT AS A MOVEMENT FROM A LARGER SENSE OF A UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY AMONG FACULTY TO A TRIBAL MENTALITY. BUT THE CURRENT SHIFT EXTENDS WELL THE WEAKENING OF DISCIPLINES AND DEPARTMENTS, BEYOND FACULTY AS INDIVIDUAL ACTORS TO THE INTERNAL ORGANIZATION OF THE ACADEMY AND A RELATIVELY NEW CONCEPT OF PROFIT AND LOSS CENTERS. THIS SHIFT TOWARD WHAT I CALL “UNIVERSITY DEVOLUTION” OR FRAGMENTATION IS INFLUENCED BY THE EXTERNAL POLITICAL, SOCIAL, AND ECONOMIC WORLD. IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, NEO-LIBERAL MINISTRIES WIELD GREAT POWER AND HAVE HELPED PUSHED UNIVERSITIES TOWARD THIS MODEL. IN THE US, IT REMAINS LARGELY A PHENOMENON INFLUENCED BY REDUCED GOVERNMENT INVESTMENT YET ULTIMATELY DRIVEN BY INTERNAL DECISION-MAKING RELATED TO PRIVATIZATION – THUS FAR. THE PAPER ENDS WITH A BRIEF DISCUSSION ON WHETHER THE ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIORS IN US RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES ARE REFLECTIVE OF GLOBAL TRENDS, OR ARE IN SOME ASPECTS UNIQUE.DOWNLOAD

									LINK TO PUBLICATION THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, MEASURING “LEARNING OUTCOMES” IS VIEWED BY MANY STAKEHOLDERS AS A RELATIVELY NEW METHOD TO JUDGE THE “VALUE ADDED” OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THE POTENTIAL TO ACCURATELY MEASURE LEARNING GAINS IS ALSO A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR INSTITUTIONAL SELF-IMPROVEMENT. THIS ESSAY DISCUSSED THE MARKETISATION OF LEARNING OUTCOMES TESTS, AND THE RELATIVE MERITS OF STUDENT EXPERIENCE SURVEYS IN GAUGING LEARNING OUTCOMES BY ANALYZING RESULTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA’S UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE SURVEY (STUDENT EXPERIENCE IN THE RESEARCH UNIVERSITY SURVEY: SERU-S). THE SERU-S INCLUDES RESPONSES BY SENIORS WHO ENTERED AS FRESHMEN ON SIX EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES SELF-REPORTS: ANALYTICAL AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS, WRITING SKILLS, READING AND COMPREHENSION SKILLS, ORAL PRESENTATION SKILLS, QUANTITATIVE SKILLS, AND SKILLS IN A PARTICULAR FIELD OF STUDY. ALTHOUGH SELF-REPORTED GAINS ARE SOMETIMES REGARDED AS HAVING DUBIOUS VALIDITY COMPARED TO SO-CALLED “DIRECT MEASURES” OF STUDENT LEARNING, THE ANALYSIS OF THIS STUDY REVEALS THE SERU SURVEY DESIGN HAS MANY ADVANTAGES, ESPECIALLY IN LARGE, COMPLEX INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS. WITHOUT EXCLUDING OTHER FORMS OF GAUGING LEARNING OUTCOMES, WE CONCLUDE THAT, DESIGNED PROPERLY, STUDENT SURVEYS OFFER A VALUABLE AND MORE NUANCED ALTERNATIVE IN UNDERSTANDING AND IDENTIFYING LEARNING OUTCOMES IN THE BROAD TAPESTRY OF HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS. WE DISCUSS THE POLITICS OF THE LEARNING OUTCOMES RACE, THE VALIDITY OF STANDARDIZED TESTS LIKE THE COLLEGIATE LEARNING ASSESSMENT (CLA), AND WHAT WE CAN LEARN FROM STUDENT SURVEYS LIKE SERU-S. WE ALSO SUGGEST THERE IS A TENSION BETWEEN WHAT MEETS THE ACCOUNTABILITY DESIRES OF GOVERNMENTS AND THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSITIES FOCUSED ON SELF-IMPROVEMENT.DOWNLOAD 
									LINK TO PUBLICATION  THE SEARCH FOR THE HOLY GRAIL TO MEASURE LEARNING GAINS STARTED IN THE US, BUT THE ORGANISATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) WANTS TO TAKE IT GLOBAL. HERE WE TELL A BIT OF THIS STORY AND RAISE SERIOUS QUESTIONS REGARDING THE VALIDITY OF THE COLLEGIATE LEARNING ASSESSMENT TEST AND SUGGEST THERE ARE ALTERNATIVES. THE MERIT OF THE CLA AS A TRUE ASSESSMENT OF LEARNING OUTCOMES IS, WE DARE SAY, DEBATABLE. IN PART, THE ARRIVAL AND SUCCESS OF THE CLA IS A STORY OF MARKETS. IN ESSENCE, IT IS A SUCCESSFULLY MARKETED PRODUCT THAT IS FULFILLING A GROWING DEMAND WITH FEW RECOGNIZED COMPETITORS. AS A RESULT, THE CLA IS WINNING THE “LEARNING OUTCOMES RACE,” ESSENTIALLY BECOMING THE “GOLD STANDARD” IN THE US. WE WORRY THAT THE CLA’S EARLY MARKET SUCCESS IS POTENTIALLY THWARTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER VALUABLE AND MORE NUANCED ALTERNATIVES – WHETHER IT BE OTHER TYPES OF STANDARDIZED TESTS THAT ATTEST TO MEASURING THE LEARNING CURVE OF STUDENTS, OR OTHER APPROACHES SUCH AS STUDENT PORTFOLIOS, CONTEXTUALLY DESIGNED SURVEYS ON THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE, AND ALUMNI FEEDBACK. IN A NEW STUDY PUBLISHED IN THE JOURNAL HIGHER EDUCATION, WE EXAMINE THE RELATIVE MERITS OF STUDENT EXPERIENCE SURVEYS IN GAUGING LEARNING OUTCOMES BY ANALYZING RESULTS FROM THE DATA FROM THE STUDENT EXPERIENCE IN THE RESEARCH UNIVERSITY (SERU) SURVEY. THIS ESSAY DISCUSSES SOME OF THE MAIN POINTS FROM THAT ARTICLE. THERE ARE REAL PROBLEMS WITH STUDENT SELF-ASSESSMENTS. BUT AS WE ARGUE HERE, UNIVERSITIES CAN PROBABLY LEARN MORE ABOUT LEARNING OUTCOMES IN A WIDE RANGE OF DISCIPLINES VIA PROPERLY DESIGNED CENSUS SURVEYS THAN BY STANDARDIZED TESTS LIKE THE CLA. AT PRESENT, WE SUGGEST THERE IS TENSION BETWEEN THE ACCOUNTABILITY DESIRES OF GOVERNMENTS AND THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL UNIVERSITIES WHO MUST FOCUS ON INSTITUTIONAL SELF-IMPROVEMENT. ONE MIGHT HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE SYNONYMOUS. BUT HOW TO MAKE MINISTRIES AND OTHER POLICYMAKERS MORE FULLY UNDERSTAND THE PERILS OF A SILVER BULLET TEST TOOL?DOWNLOAD

FROM 2000 TO 2010, THE SECTOR GREW BY SOME 235 PERCENT IN ENROLLMENT, INCREASING ITS MARKET SHARE FROM 3 TO 9.1 PERCENT OF ALL TERTIARY ENROLLED STUDENTS. WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR THIS RAPID GROWTH IN THE FOR-PROFIT (FP) SECTOR IN THE US? HOW WILL SUCH GROWTH INFLUENCE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY AND DEGREE ATTAINMENT RATES IN A COUNTRY THAT FIRST PIONEERED A MASS HIGHER EDUCATION BUILT LARGELY AROUND EXPANDING PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES? AS DISCUSSED IN THE FOLLOWING ESSAY, THERE ARE SPECIFIC CHARACTERISTICS OF THE FP SECTOR THAT ARE PECULIAR TO THE US; OTHERS REFLECT GLOBAL TRENDS LARGELY SEEN IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES. SIMPLY PUT, IN THE US AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD, THE FP SECTOR IS A MODERN FEATURE OF CHANGING MARKET DYNAMICS RELATED TO DEMAND AND SUPPLY – OR THE LACK THEREOF. AS DISCUSSED IN THIS ESSAY, THE CURRENT US EXPERIENCE IS A VERSION OF WHAT I CALL THE “BRAZILIAN EFFECT”: WHEN PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION CANNOT KEEP PACE WITH GROWING PUBLIC DEMAND FOR ACCESS AND PROGRAMS, GOVERNMENTS OFTEN ALLOW FP’S TO RUSH IN AND HELP FILL THE GAP, BECOMING A MUCH LARGER AND SOMETIMES DOMINANT PROVIDER. THIS IS THE PATTERN IN MANY DEVELOPING ECONOMIES SUCH AS BRAZIL WHERE SOME 50 PERCENT OF STUDENT ENROLLMENT IS IN PROFIT-LIKE PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS ALSO FOUND IN KOREA, POLAND AND MANY OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. DESPITE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ECONOMIC MODEL OF FOR-PROFITS WHICH RELY HEAVILY ON TAXPAYER FUNDS, THEIR LOW DEGREE COMPLETION RATES, THE QUALITY OF THOSE DEGREES, THEIR HIGH TUITION AND FEE LEVELS, THE HIGH LEVELS OF DEBT AND POOR EMPLOYMENT RECORD OF GRADUATES, AND NEW FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND A SERIES OF LAWSUITS, MY PREDICTION IS THAT THE FP SECTOR WILL CONTINUE TO GROW OVER THE LONG-TERM NOT SO MUCH BECAUSE IT MEETS SOCIETAL DEMANDS FOR DIVERSE FORMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT BECAUSE OF THE INABILITY OF THE PUBLIC SECTOR TO RETURN TO THE LEVELS OF PUBLIC SUBSIDIES AND PROGRAM GROWTH THEY HAD IN THE PAST – THE BRAZILIAN EFFECT. THE RESULT NOW, AND IN THE FUTURE, IS A KIND OF POLICY DEFAULT: THE FUTURE TERTIARY MARKET WILL NOT BE THE RESULT OF A WELL THOUGHT OUT POLICY AT THE NATIONAL OR STATE LEVELS, BUT A QUASI-FREE MARKET RESULT THAT WILL FOSTER LOWER QUALITY PROVIDERS AND FAIL TO MEET NATIONAL GOALS FOR INCREASING THE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT LEVEL OF AMERICANS. AS THIS PAPER DISCUSSES, HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY IS ABOUT BROAD ISSUES OF SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY AND ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS, BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT MONEY, BIG BUSINESS, AND POLITICAL INFLUENCE.DOWNLOAD

CALIFORNIA ALONE HAD NEARLY 100,000 INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WITH AN ECONOMIC IMPACT OF NEARLY $3.0 BILLION. IN THIS PAPER, WE OUTLINE A STRATEGY FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO/BAY AREA TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS ENROLLED IN LOCAL COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES IN TEN YEARS OR LESS, GENERATING A TOTAL DIRECT ECONOMIC IMPACT OF AN ADDITIONAL $1 BILLION A YEAR INTO THE REGIONAL ECONOMY. THE US RETAINS A HUGE MARKET ADVANTAGE FOR ATTRACTING FOREIGN STUDENTS. WITHIN THE US, THE SAN FRANCISCO/BAY AREA IS PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE AND COULD PREVAIL AS AN EXTRAORDINARY GLOBAL TALENT MAGNET, IF ONLY POLICYMAKERS AND HIGHER EDUCATION LEADERS BETTER UNDERSTOOD THIS AND FORMULATED STRATEGIES TO TAP THE GLOBAL DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. ULTIMATELY, ALL GLOBALISM IS LOCAL. WE PROPOSE THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO/BAY AREA, A REGION WITH A GROUP OF STELLAR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, SHOULD RE-IMAGINE ITSELF AS A GLOBAL HIGHER EDUCATION HUB TO MEET NATIONAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC NEEDS, AS WELL AS THE THIRST OF A GROWING WORLD POPULATION FOR HIGH-QUALITY TERTIARY EDUCATION. OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED THEIR VERSION OF THE HIGHER EDUCATION HUB IDEA. THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN OUR PROPOSED CALIFORNIAN VERSION IS THAT FOREIGN COMPETITORS SEEK TO ATTRACT FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES TO HELP BUILD ENROLLMENT AND PROGRAM CAPACITY AT HOME, AND ARE FUNDED ALMOST SOLELY BY SIGNIFICANT GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES. OUR MODEL BUILDS CAPACITY, BUT IS FOCUSED ON ATTRACTING THE WORLDÂ€™S TALENT AND GENERATING ADDITIONAL INCOME TO EXISTING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. DOUBLING INTERNATIONAL ENROLLMENT FROM 30,000 TO 60,000 STUDENTS IN TEN YEARS OR LESS WILL REQUIRE EXPANDING REGIONAL ENROLLMENT CAPACITY AS PART OF A STRATEGY TO ENSURE ACCESS TO NATIVE STUDENTS, AND AS PART OF A SCHEME TO ATTRACT A NEW GENERATION OF FACULTY AND RESEARCHERS TO THE BAY AREA AND CALIFORNIA. INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WOULD NEED TO PAY HIGHER THEN THE FULL COST OF THEIR EDUCATION, HELPING TO SUBSIDIZE DOMESTIC STUDENTS AND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS. THE RESULT WOULD BE A SAN FRANCISCO/BAY AREA GLOBAL HIGHER EDUCATION HUB Â€“ A SELF-REINFORCING KNOWLEDGE ECOSYSTEM THAT IS INTERNATIONALLY ATTRACTIVE, SOCIALLY BENEFICIAL, AND ECONOMICALLY VIABLE. WE OFFER A PATH FOR ANALYZING THE FEASIBILITY OF THIS GLOBAL HIGHER EDUCATION HUB, INCLUDING THE STEPS NECESSARY TO ENGAGE THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO HELP CREATE ENROLLMENT CAPACITY AND ACADEMIC PROGRAMS, A DISCUSSION OF A FINANCIAL MODEL, POSSIBLE MARKETING STRATEGIES, AND FOR DEVELOPING SHARED FACILITIES AND SERVICES. THIS INITIATIVE WILL REQUIRE MOST BAY AREA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES, INCLUDING UC BERKELEY AND STANFORD UNIVERSITY, TO COLLABORATE. BY PROVIDING A LEADERSHIP ROLE, BERKELEY AND STANFORD WOULD HELP BRAND THE HUB IDEA INTERNATIONALLY, PROVIDE LEADERSHIP IN SHAPING DIRECT AND INDIRECT ECONOMIC RETURNS OF THE SF/BAY AREA HIGHER EDUCATION HUB, WHILE ALSO GAINING FROM THE INCREASED INTERNATIONAL ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE REGION AND THE USE OF SHARED FACILITIES. IT IS ABOUT THE MONEY. BUT IT IS ALSO ABOUT ESTABLISHING CLOSER TIES WITH THE REGIONAL UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, BUSINESS INTERESTS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, ENHANCING THE QUALITY AND REPUTATION OF OUR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, BUILDING ENROLLMENT CAPACITY FOR NATIVE STUDENTS, INTEGRATING INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVES INTO THE ACTIVITIES AND LEARNING OF STUDENTS AND FACULTY, AND BROADENING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INTERNATIONAL COLLABORATIONS. IT IS ABOUT SOLIDIFYING THE BAY AREA AS A GLOBAL TALENT MAGNET, ONE THAT IS EVEN MORE CULTURALLY DIVERSE, EVEN MORE INNOVATIVE, AND THAT CONTINUES TO ATTRACT TALENT FROM THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WE CONCLUDE THE PAPER BY SUGGESTING THAT A REGIONALLY BASED KNOWLEDGE HUB WOULD ALSO BE A VIABLE STRATEGY FOR A SELECT GROUP OF OTHER URBAN AREAS OF THE US. DOWNLOAD 
									DOWNLOAD A PDF  (2MB)2010 MARKS THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF CALIFORNIA’S FAMED MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION, ARGUABLY THE SINGLE MOST INFLUENTIAL EFFORT TO PLAN THE FUTURE OF A SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE ANNALS OF AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION. THIS ESSAY BUILDS ON THE ANALYSIS OFFERED IN A PREVIOUS CSHE RESEARCH PAPER (“FROM CHAOS TO ORDER AND BACK”) BY DISCUSSING THE MAJOR CHALLENGES FACING CALIFORNIA’S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM, AND OFFERING A POSSIBLY PATHWAY TO REFORMS AND INSTITUTION-BUILDING ESSENTIAL FOR BOLSTERING SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY AND GREATER ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. MOST CRITICS AND OBSERVERS OF CALIFORNIA’S SYSTEM REMAIN FOCUSED ON INCREMENTAL AND LARGELY MARGINAL IMPROVEMENTS, TRANSFIXED BY THE STATE’S PERSISTENT FINANCIAL PROBLEMS AND INABILITY TO ENGAGE IN LONG-RANGE PLANNING FOR A POPULATION THAT IS PROJECTED TO GROW FROM APPROXIMATELY 37 MILLION TO SOME 60 MILLION BY 2050. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SET A NATIONAL GOAL FOR THE US TO ONCE AGAIN HAVE AMONG THE HIGHEST EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT RATES IN THE WORLD. THIS WOULD REQUIRE THE NATION TO PRODUCE OVER 8 MILLION ADDITIONAL DEGREES; CALIFORNIA’S “FAIR SHARE” WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION ADDITIONAL DEGREES. A NUMBER OF STUDIES INDICATE THAT CALIFORNIA’S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WILL NOT KEEP PACE WITH LABOR NEEDS IN THE STATE, LET ALONE AFFORDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY THAT ONCE CHARACTERIZED CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO RE-IMAGINE ITS ONCE VIBRANT HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE OBJECTIVE IS TO OFFER A VISION OF A MORE MATURE SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT COULD EMERGE OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS; IN ESSENCE, A LOGICAL NEXT STAGE IN A SYSTEM THAT HAS HARDLY CHANGED IN THE LAST FIVE DECADES. INFORMED BY THE HISTORY OF THE TRIPARTITE SYSTEM, ITS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES OVER TIME, AND THE REFORM EFFORTS OF ECONOMIC COMPETITORS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WHO ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN THEIR OWN TERTIARY INSTITUTIONS, I OFFER A “RE-IMAGINED” NETWORK OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES AND A PLAN FOR “SMART GROWTH.” I PAINT A PICTURE THAT BUILDS ON CALIFORNIA’S EXISTING INSTITUTIONS, PREDICATED ON A MORE DIVERSE ARRAY OF INSTITUTIONAL TYPES, AND ROOTED IN THE HISTORICAL IDEA OF MISSION DIFFERENTIATION. THIS INCLUDES SETTING EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT GOALS FOR THE STATE; SHIFTING MORE STUDENTS TO 4-YEAR INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING UC AND CSU; REORGANIZING THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO INCLUDE A SET OF 4-YEAR INSTITUTIONS, ANOTHER SET OF “TRANSFER FOCUSED” CAMPUSES, AND HAVING THESE COLLEGES DEVELOP A “GAP” YEAR PROGRAM FOR STUDENTS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL TO BETTER PREPARE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. IT ALSO ENCOMPASSES CREATING A NEW POLYTECHNIC UNIVERSITY SECTOR, A NEW CALIFORNIA OPEN UNIVERSITY THAT IS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON ADULT LEARNERS; AND DEVELOPING A NEW FUNDING MODEL THAT RECOGNIZES THE CRITICAL ROLE OF TUITION, AND THE MARKET FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS THAT CAN GENERATE INCOME FOR HIGHER EDUCATION AND ATTRACT TOP TALENT TO CALIFORNIA. THERE IS ALSO A NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT FOR THE US TO INCREASE DEGREE ATTAINMENT RATES, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL NEED TO BECOME A MORE ENGAGED PARTNER WITH THE STATES. FOR THE NEAR AND POSSIBLY LONG-TERM, MOST STATE GOVERNMENTS ARE IN A FISCALLY WEAKENED POSITION THAT MAKES ANY LARGE-SCALE INVESTMENT IN EXPANDING ACCESS IMPROBABLE. BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF ITS POPULATION ALONE, CALIFORNIA IS THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. IF THE US IS TO MAKE MAJOR STRIDES TOWARD PRESIDENT OBAMA’S GOAL, IT CANNOT DO IT WITHOUT CALIFORNIA.DOWNLOAD

IT WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE ARGUABLY THE SINGLE MOST INFLUENTIAL EFFORT TO PLAN THE FUTURE OF A SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE ANNALS OF AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION. DESPITE POPULAR BELIEF, HOWEVER, THE CALIFORNIA MASTER PLAN FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IS MORE IMPORTANT FOR WHAT IT PRESERVED THAN WHAT IT CREATED. THERE IS MUCH CONFUSION REGARDING EXACTLY HOW THE MASTER PLAN CAME ABOUT, WHAT IT SAID AND DID NOT SAY, AND WHAT PORTIONS OF IT ARE STILL RELEVANT TODAY. THIS ESSAY PROVIDES A BRIEF HISTORICAL TOUR ON HOW CALIFORNIA DEVELOPED ITS PIONEERING HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM, WHAT THE 1960 MASTER PLAN ACCOMPLISHED, AND A DISCUSSION ON THE CURRENT PROBLEMS FACING THIS SYSTEM IN THE MIDST OF THE GREAT RECESSION. THE IMMENSE SUCCESS OF CALIFORNIA'S NETWORK OF PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAS BEEN ITS HISTORIC ACCOMPLISHMENT OF WHAT I HAVE CALLED IN A PREVIOUS BOOK, THE CALIFORNIA IDEA: THE GOAL OF BROAD ACCESS COMBINED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH QUALITY, MISSION DIFFERENTIATED, AND AFFORDABLE HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS FIRST ARTICULATED BY CALIFORNIA PROGRESSIVES. HISTORICALLY, THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN A GREAT SUCCESS, WITH AN ABILITY TO GROW WITH THE STATE'S POPULATION AND EFFECTIVELY MEET RISING DEMAND FOR ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. HOWEVER, THE FISCAL HEALTH AND PRODUCTIVITY OF CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM HAS ERODED OVER THE PAST THREE OR SO DECADES. THE GREAT RECESSION HAS GREATLY ACCELERATED THIS TRAJECTORY. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS, PUBLIC FUNDING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION HAS BEEN REDUCED BY SOME $1 BILLION. TUITION AND FEES HAVE CLIMBED, BUT HAVE NOT PRODUCED SUFFICIENT REVENUE TO MITIGATE LARGE BUDGET CUTS. THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY HAVE LIMITED ENROLLMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND IN THE MIDST OF GROWING ENROLLMENT DEMAND. CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MEET ENROLLMENT DEMAND. THERE IS THE PROSPECT OF CONTINUED CUTS IN THE 2010-11 FISCAL YEAR AS FEDERAL STIMULUS FUNDS FOR STATE GOVERNMENTS DISAPPEAR. CALIFORNIA IS PROJECTED TO GROW FROM ITS CURRENT 37 MILLION PEOPLE TO SOME 60 MILLION IN 2050. IN ADDITION, PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS SET A NATIONAL GOAL FOR THE US TO ONCE AGAIN HAVE AMONG THE HIGHEST EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT RATES IN THE WORLD. THIS WOULD REQUIRE THE NATION TO PRODUCE OVER 8 MILLION ADDITIONAL DEGREES; CALIFORNIA'S ""FAIR SHARE"" WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION ADDITIONAL DEGREES - A NUMBER MADE LARGER, BECAUSE OF THE STATE'S CURRENT RANK AMONG THE BOTTOM TEN STATES IN DEGREE PRODUCTION RELATIVE TO THE SIZE OF ITS POPULATION. THIS RAISES A NUMBER OF BIG QUESTIONS: CAN CALIFORNIA SUSTAIN THE SYSTEM AS OUTLINED BY THE 1960 MASTER PLAN? EVEN IF IT CAN, IS IT, AS THE BRITISH SAY, ""FIT FOR PURPOSE?"" OR IS IT OUTDATED FOR PRODUCING ROBUST LEVELS OF SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY AND THE TRAINED LABOR NEEDED FOR TOMORROW'S ECONOMY? HOW CAN CALIFORNIA RETAIN THE CALIFORNIA IDEA OF BROAD ACCESS AND QUALITY ACADEMIC PROGRAMS? WHILE ADEQUATE FUNDING IS A MAJOR VARIABLE, THIS ESSAY IDENTIFIES A NUMBER OF SERIOUS PROBLEMS WITH THE STRUCTURE OF CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM THAT MAKE MEETING OBAMA'S GOAL EXTREMELY DIFFICULT, IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE TO ACHIEVE. THESE INCLUDE MACRO EFFECTS OF TOO MANY PART-TIME STUDENTS, AN IMBALANCE IN 2-YEAR AND 4-YEAR COLLEGE ENROLLMENT, INADEQUATE FINANCIAL AID, AND THE NEED FOR A NEW PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY FUNDING MODEL. A FAILURE TO PURSUE ""SMART GROWTH"" IN THE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WILL LEAD TO A ""BRAZILIAN EFFECT,"" IN WHICH FOR-PROFITS EXPAND DRAMATICALLY TO HELP PARTIALLY FILL GROWING DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION PROBABLY AT POSSIBLY EVEN GREATER COST TO STUDENTS AND GOVERNMENT, AND WITH OFTEN LOW-QUALITY ACADEMIC DEGREE PROGRAMS.DOWNLOAD 
									DOWNLOAD A PDF (2MB)IN THE MIDST OF THE GLOBAL RECESSION, HOW HAVE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS VIEWED THE ROLE OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN THEIR EVOLVING STRATEGIES FOR ECONOMIC RECOVERY? DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION GENERALLY GOES UP DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. WHICH NATIONS HAVE PROACTIVELY PROTECTED FUNDING FOR THEIR UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES TO HELP MAINTAIN ACCESS, TO HELP RETRAIN WORKERS, AND TO MITIGATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATES? AND WHICH NATIONS HAVE SIMPLY MADE LARGE FUNDING CUTS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION IN LIGHT OF THE SEVERE DOWNTURN IN TAX REVENUES? THIS ESSAY PROVIDES A MOMENT-IN-TIME REVIEW OF THE FATE OF HIGHER EDUCATION AMONG A NUMBER OF OECD NATIONS AND OTHER COUNTRIES, WITH A PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE UNITED STATES, AND ON CALIFORNIA – THE LARGEST STATE IN TERMS OF POPULATION AND IN THE SIZE OF ITS ECONOMY. PRELIMINARY INDICATORS SHOW THAT MOST NATIONS HAVE NOT THUS FAR RESORTED TO UNCOORDINATED CUTTING OF FUNDING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION THAT WE GENERALLY SEE IN US STATE SYSTEMS. THEIR POLITICAL LEADERS SEE HIGHER EDUCATION AS A KEY TO SHORT-TERM ECONOMIC RECOVERY, LONG-TERM COMPETITIVENESS, AND OFTEN THEIR OWN POLITICAL VIABILITY – PARTICULARLY IN NATIONS WITH UPCOMING ELECTIONS. FURTHER, ALTHOUGH THIS IS SPECULATIVE, IT APPEARS THAT MANY NATIONS ARE USING THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN TO ACTUALLY ACCELERATE REFORM POLICIES, SOME INTENDED TO PROMOTE EFFICIENCIES, BUT MOST FOCUSED ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF THEIR UNIVERSITY SECTOR AND PROMOTING INNOVATION IN THEIR ECONOMIES. ONE MIGHT POSTULATE THAT THE DECISIONS MADE TODAY AND IN REACTION TO THE “GREAT RECESSION” BY NATIONS WILL LIKELY SPEED UP GLOBAL SHIFTS IN THE RACE TO DEVELOP HUMAN CAPITAL,WITH THE US PROBABLY LOSING SOME GROUND. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION’S FIRST STIMULUS PACKAGE HELPED MITIGATE LARGE STATE BUDGET CUTS TO PUBLIC SERVICES IN 2009-10 AND TO SUPPORT EXPANDED ENROLLMENTS LARGELY AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL. BUT IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO AVOID HAVING UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES LAY OFF FACULTY AND STAFF, REDUCE SALARIES AND BENEFITS, OFTEN ELIMINATING COURSE OFFERINGS THAT SLOW STUDENT PROGRESS TOWARDS A DEGREE, OR MAKING SIZABLE REDUCTIONS IN ACCESS IN STATES SUCH AS CALIFORNIA. STATES HAVE VERY LIMITED ABILITY TO BORROW FUNDS FOR OPERATING COSTS, MAKING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE LAST RESORT. IN SHORT, HOW STATE BUDGETS GO, SO GOES US HIGHER EDUCATION; WHEREAS MOST NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION FINANCING IS TIED TO NATIONAL BUDGETS WITH AN ABILITY TO BORROW. WITHOUT THE CURRENT STIMULUS FUNDING, THE IMPACT ON ACCESS AND MAINTAINING THE HEALTH OF AMERICA’S UNIVERSITIES WOULD HAVE BEEN EVEN MORE DEVASTATING. BUT THAT MONEY WILL BE LARGELY SPENT BY THE 2011 FISCAL YEAR (OCT 2010-SEPT 2011), UNLESS CONGRESS AND THE WHITE HOUSE RENEW FUNDING SUPPORT ON A SIMILAR SCALE FOR STATES THAT ARE COPING WITH PROJECTED LARGE BUDGET GAPS. THAT NOW SEEMS UNLIKELY. THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED ITS PROPOSED 2011 BUDGET IN FEBRUARY, INCLUDING $25 BILLION IN STATE AID TARGETED FOR MEDICAID. THIS IS A MODEST CONTRIBUTION TO STATES THAT FACE PROJECTED CUMULATIVE BUDGET DEFICITS OF $142 BILLION IN 2011, AND THERE IS UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE FINAL FEDERAL BUDGET. THIS IS BECAUSE OBAMA’S PROPOSAL WILL BE DEBATED AND VOTED ON IN A CONGRESS INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON STEMMING THE TIDE OF RISING FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICITS. WITHOUT SUBSTANTIALLY MORE FEDERAL AID TO STATE GOVERNMENTS, MANY PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WILL FACE ANOTHER MAJOR ROUND OF BUDGET CUTS.   THERE IS THE PROSPECT THAT HIGHER EDUCATION DEGREE PRODUCTION RATES IN THE US WILL DIP IN THE NEAR TERM, PARTICULARLY IN STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCED ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION EVEN AS ENROLLMENT DEMAND HAS GONE UP.DOWNLOAD

THERE CLEARLY ARE A COMPLEX SET OF VARIABLES THAT WILL INFLUENCE INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION AND GLOBAL LABOR MARKETS, INCLUDING THE CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECESSION. ULTIMATELY, HOWEVER, WE THINK THESE FACTORS WILL NOT ALTER THE FUNDAMENTAL DYNAMICS OF THE NEW GLOBAL MARKET, WHICH INCLUDE THESE FACTS: THE INTERNATIONAL FLOW OF TALENT, SCIENTIFIC OR OTHERWISE, IS BEING FUNDAMENTALLY ALTERED AS NATIONS INVEST MORE IN EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND HUMAN CAPITAL; THE US WILL CONTINUE TO LOSE SOME OF ITS MARKET SHARE OVER TIM E — THE ONLY QUESTION IS HOW QUICKLY AND BY HOW MUCH; AND WITHOUT A PROACTIVE STRATEGY, NATIONS SUCH AS THE US THAT ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON GLOBAL IN-MIGRATION OF TALENTED STUDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS ARE MOST VULNERABLE TO DOWNWARD ACCESS TO GLOBAL TALENT, WITH A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FUTURE ECONOMIC GROWTH. THIS STUDY PROVIDES DATA ON PAST AND RECENT GLOBAL TRENDS IN INTERNATIONAL ENROLLMENT, AND OFFERS A SET OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE US AT THE FEDERAL, STATE, AND INSTITUTIONAL LEVEL. THIS INCLUDES OUR RECOMMENDATION OF A NATIONAL GOAL TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS IN THE US OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO MATCH NUMBERS IN A GROUP OF COMPETITOR NATIONS, AND REQUIRES RECOGNITION THAT THE US WILL NEED TO STRATEGICALLY EXPAND ITS ENROLLMENT CAPACITY AND GRADUATION RATES TO ACCOMMODATE NEEDED INCREASES IN THE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT RATE OF US CITIZENS, AND TO WELCOME MORE INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. ATTRACTING TALENT IN A GLOBAL MARKET AND INCREASING DEGREE ATTAINMENT RATES OF THE DOMESTIC POPULATION ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE GOALS. INDEED, THEY WILL BE THE HALLMARKS OF THE MOST COMPETITIVE ECONOMIES.DOWNLOAD 
									DOWNLOAD A PDF  (728KB)THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, INTEREST IN GAUGING LEARNING OUTCOMES AT ALL LEVELS OF EDUCATION HAS GROWN CONSIDERABLY OVER THE PAST DECADE. IN HIGHER EDUCATION, MEASURING “LEARNING OUTCOMES” IS VIEWED BY MANY STAKEHOLDERS AS A RELATIVELY NEW METHOD TO JUDGE THE “VALUE ADDED” OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES. THE POTENTIAL TO ACCURATELY MEASURE LEARNING GAINS IS ALSO VIEWED AS A DIAGNOSTIC TOOL FOR INSTITUTIONAL SELF-IMPROVEMENT. THIS ESSAY COMPARES THE METHODOLOGY AND POTENTIAL USES OF THREE TOOLS FOR MEASURING LEARNING OUTCOMES: THE COLLEGIATE LEARNING ASSESSMENT (CLA), THE NATIONAL SURVEY OF STUDENT ENGAGEMENT (NSSE), AND THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA’S UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE SURVEY (UCUES). IN ADDITION, WE EXAMINE UCUES 2008 RESPONSES OF SENIORS WHO ENTERED AS FRESHMEN ON SIX OF THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES SELF-REPORTS: ANALYTICAL AND CRITICAL THINKING SKILLS, WRITING SKILLS, READING AND COMPREHENSION SKILLS, ORAL PRESENTATION SKILLS, QUANTITATIVE SKILLS, AND SKILLS IN A PARTICULAR FIELD OF STUDY. THIS INITIAL ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT CAMPUS-WIDE ASSESSMENTS OF LEARNING OUTCOMES ARE GENERALLY NOT VALID INDICATORS OF LEARNING OUTCOMES, AND THAT SELF-REPORTED GAINS AT THE LEVEL OF THE MAJOR ARE PERHAPS THE BEST INDICATOR WE HAVE, THUS FAR, FOR ASSESSING THE VALUE-ADDED EFFECTS OF A STUDENT’S ACADEMIC EXPERIENCE AT A MAJOR RESEARCH UNIVERSITY. UCUES APPEARS THE BETTER APPROACH FOR ASSESSING AND REPORTING LEARNING OUTCOMES. THIS IS BECAUSE UCUES OFFERS MORE EXTENSIVE ACADEMIC ENGAGEMENT DATA AS WELL AS A MUCH WIDER RANGE OF DEMOGRAPHIC AND INSTITUTIONAL DATA, AND THEREFORE AN UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO ADVANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE NATURE OF SELF-REPORTED LEARNING OUTCOMES IN HIGHER EDUCATION, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE REPORTS CAN CONTRIBUTE AS INDIRECT BUT VALID MEASURES OF POSITIVE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES. AT THE SAME TIME, THE APPARENT DIFFERENCES IN LEARNING OUTCOMES ACROSS THE UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT CONTROLS FOR CAMPUS DIFFERENCES IN COMPOSITION ILLUSTRATES SOME OF THE LIMITATIONS OF SELF-REPORTED DATA.DOWNLOAD

DEMAND FOR HIGHER EDUCATION GENERALLY GOES UP DURING ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS. EXPANDING HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AND ENROLLMENT CAPACITY MAY BE AS IMPORTANT AS ANY OTHER POLICY LEVER TO COPE WITH AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, INCLUDING FUNDING FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. YET MOST STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE IN THE MIDST OF WHOLESALE CUTTING OF THEIR BUDGETS. SOME 75 PERCENT OF ALL STUDENTS IN THE US ARE IN PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS. FEELING THE EFFECTS OF REPEATED CUTS IN BUDGETS, MANY MULTICAMPUS PUBLIC SYSTEMS ARE THREATENING TO CAP ENROLLMENT DESPITE GROWING DEMAND. WOULD IT BE SMART TO CONSTRICT ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION JUST WHEN UNEMPLOYMENT RATES ARE POTENTIALLY PEAKING? AN EXPLORATORY COMMISSION ON HIGHER EDUCATION, NOT UNLIKE WHAT PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN FORMED IN 1946, BUT WITH MORE URGENCY AND POSSIBLY AN INITIAL BUDGET, MIGHT PROVIDE A LARGER VISION AND CONTEMPLATE A RANGE OF OPTIONS. SHORT-TERM AND IMMEDIATE POLICIES COULD INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT DIRECTED SUBSIDIZATION VIA STATE GOVERNMENTS OF THE PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SECTORS; A LARGE INCREASE IN FEDERAL PELL GRANTS FOR LOW-INCOME STUDENTS, ALREADY SEVERELY UNDER-FUNDED RELATIVE TO DEMAND; GREATLY EXPANDED RESOURCES FOR DIRECT LOANS; THE POSSIBILITY OF A ONE-TIME GRANT FOR MIDDLE-INCOME STUDENTS TO ATTEND A PARTICIPATING PUBLIC OR ACCREDITED PRIVATE INSTITUTION; FOR SOME TARGETED AGE GROUPS, FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION COULD BE TIED TO ENROLLMENT ACCESS TO AN ACCREDITED HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTION; AND SUPPORT OF PUBLIC COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY BUILDING PROGRAMS AS PART OF ANY NEW INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT PROGRAM. LONG-TERM GOALS SHOULD INCLUDE AN ASSESSMENT OF THE OVERALL HEALTH OF THE U.S.’S STILL FAMOUS, BUT STRAINED, HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM AND WHAT NATIONAL AND STATE GOALS MIGHT BE CONJURED. GLOBALLY, THOSE NATIONS THAT RESORT TO UNCOORDINATED AND REACTIONARY CUTTING OF FUNDING, AND REDUCTIONS IN ACCESS, WILL FIND THEMSELVES AT A DISADVANTAGE FOR DEALING WITH IMPACT OF THE WORLDWIDE RECESSION, AND WILL LOSE GROUND IN THE RACE TO DEVELOP HUMAN CAPITAL SUITABLE FOR THE MODERN ERA.DOWNLOAD

THUS FAR, HOWEVER, THERE IS NO SINGLE SOURCE ON THE FEE RATES OF COMPARATIVE RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES, NOR INFORMATION ON HOW THESE FUNDS ARE BEING USED BY INSTITUTIONS. FURTHERMORE, RESEARCH ON TUITION PRICING HAS ALSO FOCUSED LARGELY ON BACHELOR’S DEGREE PROGRAMS, AND NOT ON THE RAPID CHANGES IN TUITION AND FEES FOR PROFESSIONAL DEGREES. THIS PAPER OFFERS A BRIEF SCAN OF PRICING TRENDS AMONG A SAMPLE GROUP OF 24 PUBLIC AND PRIVATE RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IN THE US, ALL WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF GRADUATE AND PROFESSIONAL PROGRAMS, AND A SMALL SAMPLE GROUP OF EU UNIVERSITIES. WE TRACE A PATTERN OF CONVERGENCE NOT ONLY BETWEEN US PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, BUT ALSO FIND INDICATIONS THAT THESE TRENDS OCCUR AMONG EU UNIVERSITIES. WE THEORIZE THAT PRICING AMONG MAJOR RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES IS INCREASINGLY INFLUENCED BY LEVELS OF MARKET TOLERANCE, AND A CONVERGENCE IN PRICING DRIVEN IN PART BY THE PERCEPTION THAT PRICE CONFERS QUALITY AND A CORRESPONDING LEVEL OF PRESTIGE TO CONSUMERS. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON PRICING, AND HENCE DOES NOT DELVE INTO THE COMPLEX MODERATING EFFECTS OF BURSARIES AND STUDENT COSTS SUCH AS ROOM AND BOARD. THE RECENT IMPLOSION IN CREDIT MARKETS MAY SERIOUSLY SHAKE THIS EMERGING PRICING MODEL, IN LARGE PART BECAUSE IT IS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON STUDENTS TAKING OUT SIZABLE LOANS. BUT IT IS OUR SENSE THAT THE LONG-TERM TRENDS IN PRICING, INCLUDING SOME LEVEL OF CONVERGENCE, WILL CONTINUE AS INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE GLOBALLY COMPETITIVE LOOK OVER THEIR SHOULDER AT WHAT THEIR PERCEIVED PEER (OR NEAR PEER) INSTITUTIONS ARE CHARGING FOR SPECIFIC DEGREES AND PROGRAMS. THIS IN TURN WILL INFLUENCE THE ENTIRE HIGHER EDUCATION MARKET.DOWNLOAD

AT THE SAME TIME THERE HAVE BEEN SURPRISINGLY FEW STUDIES OF THE ACTUAL CHARACTERISTICS AND ACADEMIC EXPERIENCES OF LOW-INCOME STUDENTS OR COMPARISONS OF THEIR UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE WITH THOSE OF MORE WEALTHY STUDENTS. THIS PAPER EXPLORES THE DIVIDE BETWEEN POOR AND RICH STUDENTS, FIRST COMPARING A GROUP OF SELECTIVE US INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR NUMBER AND PERCENTAGE OF PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS AND THEN, USING INSTITUTIONAL DATA AND RESULTS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE SURVEY (UCUES), PRESENTING AN ANALYSIS OF THE HIGH PERCENTAGE OF LOW-INCOME UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS WITHIN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SYSTEM — WHO THEY ARE, THEIR ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE AND QUALITY OF THEIR UNDERGRADUATE EXPERIENCE. AMONG OUR CONCLUSIONS: THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HAS A STRIKINGLY HIGHER NUMBER OF LOW-INCOME STUDENTS WHEN COMPARED TO A SAMPLE GROUP OF TWENTY-FOUR OTHER SELECTIVE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES AND COLLEGES, INCLUDING THE IVY LEAGUES AND A SUB-GROUP OF OTHER CALIFORNIA INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS STANFORD AND THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. INDEED, THE UC CAMPUSES OF BERKELEY, DAVIS, AND UCLA EACH HAVE MORE PELL GRANT STUDENTS THAN ALL OF THE EIGHT IVY LEAGUE INSTITUTIONS COMBINED. HOWEVER, ONE OUT OF THREE PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS AT UC HAVE AT LEAST ONE PARENT WITH A FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE DEGREE, CALLING INTO QUESTION THE ASSUMPTION THAT “LOW-INCOME” AND “FIRST-GENERATION” ARE INTERCHANGEABLE GROUPS OF STUDENTS. LOW-INCOME STUDENTS, AND IN PARTICULAR PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS, AT UC HAVE ONLY SLIGHTLY LOWER GPAS THAN THEIR MORE WEALTHY COUNTERPARTS IN BOTH MATH, SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING, AND IN HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCE FIELDS. CONTRARY TO SOME PREVIOUS RESEARCH, WE FIND THAT LOW-INCOME STUDENTS HAVE GENERALLY THE SAME ACADEMIC AND SOCIAL SATISFACTION LEVELS; AND ARE SIMILAR IN THEIR SENSE OF BELONGING WITHIN THEIR CAMPUS COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER, THERE ARE SOME INTRIGUING RESULTS ACROSS UC CAMPUSES, WITH LOW-INCOME STUDENTS SOMEWHAT LESS SATISFIED AT THOSE CAMPUSES WHERE THERE ARE MORE AFFLUENT STUDENT BODIES AND WHERE LOWER-INCOME STUDENTS HAVE A SMALLER PRESENCE.DOWNLOAD

IN ESSENCE, THE US WAS THE FIRST MOVER IN PURSUING THE NEXUS OF SCIENCE AND ECONOMIC POLICY.

THE PAPER ALSO PROVIDES OBSERVATIONS ON MAJOR US STATE-BASED HT INITIATIVES INTENDED TO CREATE OR SUSTAIN KNOWLEDGE BASED ECONOMIC AREAS (KBEA’S). THIRTEEN VARIABLES ARE USED TO ASSESS THE OVERALL COMPARATIVE ABILITY FOR CREATING KBEA’S, INCLUDING THE VITALITY OF REGIONAL AND NATIONAL RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES, PATTERNS OF R&D INVESTMENT, ACCESS TO VENTURE CAPITAL, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS, EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT LEVELS OF THE WORKFORCE, ACCESS AND RETENTION OF GLOBAL LABOR FORCE, AND POLITICAL INTEREST AND FORMS OF GOVERNMENT SUPPORT FOR PROMOTING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.AMONG THE PAPERS CONCLUSIONS: THERE IS A LARGE DISCONNECT IN US POLICY RELATED TO PROMOTING KBEA’S AND NATIONAL COMPETITIVENESS. FEW POLICYMAKERS, OR EVEN THE HIGHER EDUCATION COMMUNITY ARE AWARE OF STAGNANT AND, IN SOME STATES, REAL DECLINES IN HIGHER EDUCATION ACCESS AND GRADUATION RATES RELATIVE TO ECONOMIC COMPETITORS, THAT THE US IS NO LONGER A NET IMPORTER OF HIGH TECH GOODS, OR THAT THE US IS NO LONGER THE NUMBER ONE DESTINATION FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS. COMBINED WITH GLOBAL CHANGES IN THE MARKET FOR S&T TALENT, AND THE SIGNIFICANT AND INCREASINGLY SUCCESSFUL EFFORT OF COMPETITORS TO INCREASE THE EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT OF THEIR POPULATION, THE US’S HT ADVANTAGE IS ERODING – ALTHOUGH THERE REMAIN A NUMBER OF STRENGTHS, CHIEFLY RELATED TO AN ENTREPRENEURIAL CULTURE, MORE CONDUCIVE TAX ADVANTAGES FOR BUSINESS, A CADRE OF ELITE RESEARCH UNIVERSITIES, AND THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF VENTURE CAPITAL IN THE WORLD. BUT EVEN HERE, THESE ADVANTAGES MAY WANE OVER THE NEXT DECADE AS THE WORLD BECOMES MORE ECONOMICALLY, AND EDUCATIONALLY, COMPETITIVE. THE US GENERALLY LACKS A BROADLY CONCEIVED STRATEGY FOR RETAINING AMERICA’S HIGH TECH ADVANTAGE.DOWNLOAD

USING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, THE NATION'S LARGEST PUBLIC RESEARCH UNIVERSITY AND AMONG ITS MOST SELECTIVE, AS AN ILLUMINATING CASE STUDY, IT EXPLORES HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY DEBATES OVER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION, GENDER, CLASS, STANDARDIZED TESTING, AND THE GROWING INFLUENCES OF PRIVATIZATION AND GLOBALIZATION, AND INDEED THE VERY PURPOSE AND FUTURE OF THESE IMPORTANT PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS.THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN THE WORLD LEADER IN DEVELOPING MASS HIGHER EDUCATION, USING ITS PIONEERING NETWORK OF PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TO PROMOTE SOCIOECONOMIC MOBILITY AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. BUT THE AUTHOR WARNS THAT ACCESS AND GRADUATION RATES HAVE STAGNATED AND MAY EVEN BE DECLINING, PARTICULARLY AMONG YOUNGER STUDENTS. OTHER COUNTRIES, INCLUDING KEY MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, ALONG WITH CHINA, INDIA, AND OTHER DEVELOPING NATIONS, ARE AGGRESSIVELY RESHAPING AND EXPANDING THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. THE “AMERICAN ADVANTAGE” OF A HIGH-QUALITY AND HIGH-ACCESS HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM IS WANING. THE CLOSING CHAPTERS EXPLORE WHY THIS IS THE CASE AND THE CONSEQUENCES WITHIN AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL ECONOMY.DOWNLOAD 
									LINK TO PUBLICATION  THE CONVERGENCE OF US FEDERAL SCIENCE AND ECONOMIC POLICY THAT BEGAN IN EARNEST IN THE REAGAN ADMINISTRATION FORMED THE FIRST STAGE IN AN EMERGING POST-COLD WAR DRIVE TOWARD TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. A FRENZY OF NEW STATE-BASED INITIATIVES NOW FORMS THE SECOND STAGE, FURTHER PROMOTING UNIVERSITIES AS DECISIVE TOOLS FOR ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS. STATE GOVERNMENTS HAVE LARGELY BECOME THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH NEW POLICY IDEAS ARE EMERGING, INFLUENCED BY A SENSE OF INCREASED COMPETITION AMONG STATES AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. THE PAPER OUTLINES THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THIS SECOND STAGE, AND OFFERS SHORT CASE STUDIES OF TWO INFLUENTIAL HT INITIATIVES IN CALIFORNIA--A LEADING HT STATE. AMONG THE AUTHOR'S CONCLUSIONS: HT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IS ALREADY RELATIVELY WIDESPREAD AMONG THE VARIOUS STATES (MORE SO THAN PERHAPS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT); LEADING HT STATES RELY HEAVILY ON THEIR UNIVERSITY SECTORS AND A HIGHLY EDUCATED WORKFORCE, YET ARE INCREASINGLY IMPORTING TALENT AND NEGLECTING INVESTMENT IN THE EDUCATION AND SKILLS OF THEIR NATIVE POPULATIONS; THE LONG-TERM COMMITMENT OF STATES TO FINANCIALLY SUPPORT THE FRENZY OF HT INITIATIVES IS UNCLEAR; AND STATE INITIATIVES ARE RATIONALIZED BY LAWMAKERS AS FILLING A NEED NOT CURRENTLY MET BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR UNIVERSITIES AND, IN PART, AS A RESPONSE TO A SENSE OF COMPETITION BETWEEN STATES, AND THUS FAR WITH ONLY A MINOR CONCERN FOR GLOBAL COMPETITION. AS THIS PAPER EXPLORES, THE POLITICS OF HT — INCLUDING THE FOCUS ON UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY COLLABORATION AND NEO-CONSERVATIVE RELIGIOUS/MORAL CONTROVERSIES OVER STEM CELL RESEARCH — IS A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR FOR UNDERSTANDING HOW AND WHY MOST STATES ARE PURSUING THE SECOND STAGE.DOWNLOAD

AFTER A CENTURY OF LEADING THE WORLD IN PARTICIPATION RATES IN HIGHER EDUCATION, HOWEVER, THERE ARE STRONG INDICATIONS THAT AMERICA'S ADVANTAGE IS WANING. THE ACADEMIC RESEARCH ENTERPRISE REMAINS RELATIVELY VIBRANT. HOWEVER, PARTICIPATION AND DEGREE ATTAINMENT RATES HAVE LEVELED OFF AND ARE SHOWING SIGNS OF ACTUAL DECLINE IN A NUMBER OF MAJOR STATES WITH LARGE POPULATIONS — AND THIS SEEMS TO BE MORE THAN JUST A BUMP OR SHORT-TERM MARKET CORRECTION. OTHER COMPETITIVE NATIONS, AND IN PARTICULAR KEY MEMBERS OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, ALONG WITH CHINA, INDIA AND OTHER DEVELOPING ECONOMIES, ARE AGGRESSIVELY NURTURING THEIR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS, EXPANDING ACCESS, AND BETTER POSITIONING THEMSELVES IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING HARDER, WHILE IN THE US PUBLIC FUNDING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION HAS DECLINED. THE NATION'S INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC CONCERNS LIE ELSEWHERE. IN ADDITION TO OUTLINING THESE REASONS THAT AMERICA'S HIGHER EDUCATION ADVANTAGE IS WANING, THIS ARTICLE ALSO DISCUSSES THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES.DOWNLOAD

THIS MEETING PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE CURRENT CIVIC ENGAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND STRATEGIES TO DEEPEN AND BROADEN EFFORTS IN THIS AREA AS WELL AS TO EXPLORE THE LEADERSHIP ROLE OUR SYSTEM MIGHT PROVIDE.

THE NEW FLAGSHIP MODEL EXPLORES PATHWAYS FOR UNIVERSITIES TO RE-SHAPE THEIR MISSIONS AND ACADEMIC CULTURES, AND TO PURSUE ORGANIZATIONAL FEATURES INTENDED TO EXPAND THEIR RELEVANCY IN THE SOCIETIES THAT GIVE THEM LIFE AND PURPOSE. IN THIS QUEST, INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE FOCUSED LARGELY ON RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY ARE NOT IGNORED, BUT ARE FRAMED AS ONLY ONE GOAL TOWARDS SUPPORTING A UNIVERSITY'S PRODUCTIVITY AND LARGER SOCIAL PURPOSE—NOT AS AN END UNTO ITSELF. CHAPTERS BY CONTRIBUTING AUTHORS DETAIL THE HISTORICAL AND CONTEMPORARY ROLE OF LEADING NATIONAL UNIVERSITY IN ASIA, SOUTH AMERICA, RUSSIA, AND SCANDINAVIA, AND CONSIDER HOW THE NEW FLAGSHIP MODEL MIGHT BE APPLIED AND EXPANDED ON. IT HAS BEEN NEARLY FORTY YEARS SINCE CLARK KERR WAS ASKED TO CREATE AND LEAD THE CARNEGIE COMMISSION ON HIGHER EDUCATION UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION. THE COMMISSION WAS TO BE A NATIONAL EFFORT, UNPRECEDENTED BOTH IN SCOPE AND IN THE FREEDOM OF ITS DIRECTOR, KERR, TO GUIDE ITS RESEARCH AND PRODUCTIVITY. CARNEGIE PRESIDENT ALAN PIFER PROMISED SUBSTANTIAL FUNDING FOR FIVE YEARS OR MORE. WORKING WITH PIFER, AND WITH ALDEN DUNHAM, DAVID ROBINSON, AND OTHERS, KERR INITIATED A GREAT ARRAY OF STUDIES AND PROVIDE RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE MOST VITAL ISSUES FACING AMERICAN HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE LATTER PART OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. THIS ESSAY REVIEWS THE ORIGINS OF THE COMMISSION, ITS SUCCESSOR ORGANIZATION, THE CARNEGIE COUNCIL, AND THE INFLUENCE OF A NUMBER OF MAJOR REPORTS. THE ESSAY ALSO NOTES THE NEED TO REVISIT THE WORK OF THE COMMISSION AND COUNCIL AS A SOURCE OF IDEAS RELEVANT TODAY, AND SUGGESTS THAT THERE IS A NEED FOR A GREATER NATIONAL APPROACH TO SUPPORTING US HIGHER EDUCATION.DOWNLOAD

BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2006, UNIVERSITIES AND FURTHER EDUCATION COLLEGES IN ENGLAND AND WALES WILL CHARGE VARIABLE FEES WITHIN LIMITS SET BY A DEFINED CAP AND BY MINISTRY DEMANDS FOR INCREASES IN INSTITUTIONAL AID FOR LOWER INCOME STUDENTS. THIS ESSAY CHRONICLES THE RESPONSE OF ENGLAND’S UNIVERSITIES. NOT SURPRISINGLY, MOST WILL CHARGE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT ALLOWED; AT THE SAME TIME, LEVELS OF BURSARIES (FINANCIAL AID) WILL VARY BETWEEN INSTITUTIONS. THE RESPONSE AND PLANS OF ENGLISH UNIVERSITIES, AND THE SUBSEQUENT RESPONSE OF BOTH THE MARKET AND STUDENTS, WILL LIKELY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE ON OTHER OECD NATIONS, PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION, AS THEY GRADUALLY CONSIDER A SIMILAR VARIABLE FEE SCHEME.DOWNLOAD

MUCH OF THE RHETORIC OF GLOBALISTS HAS PRESENTED A SIMPLISTIC ANALYSIS OF A PARADIGM SHIFT IN HIGHER EDUCATION MARKETS AND THE WAY NATIONS AND INSTITUTIONS DELIVER EDUCATIONAL SERVICES. THIS ESSAY PROVIDES AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK FOR UNDERSTANDING GLOBAL INFLUENCES ON NATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS. IT THEN IDENTIFIES AND DISCUSSES THE COUNTERVAILING FORCES TO GLOBALIZATION THAT HELP TO ILLUMINATE THE COMPLEXITIES OF THE EFFECTS OF GLOBALIZATION (INCLUDING THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TRADE AND SERVICES) AND NEW INSTRUCTIONAL TECHNOLOGIES ON THE DELIVERY AND MARKET FOR TEACHING AND LEARNING SERVICES. GLOBALIZATION DOES OFFER SUBSTANTIAL AND POTENTIALLY SWEEPING CHANGES TO NATIONAL SYSTEMS OF HIGHER EDUCATION, BUT THERE IS NO UNIFORM INFLUENCE ON NATION-STATES OR INSTITUTIONS.

THESE CHANGES WOULD BUILD ON THREE MAJOR PARADIGM SHIFTS AND EXPERIMENTS IN SYSTEM BUILDING IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SINCE WORLD WAR II: THE CREATION AND SUBSEQUENT COLLAPSE OF A BINARY SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT INCLUDED BOTH UNIVERSITIES AND POLYTECHNICS; A DECREASE IN GOVERNMENTAL FUNDING AND AN INCREASE IN REGULATIONS; AND THE INTRODUCTION OF STUDENT FEES INTO THE PREVIOUSLY EXCLUSIVELY GOVERNMENT-FUNDED HIGHER EDUCATION SECTOR. THE LABOUR GOVERNMENT'S NEW WHITE PAPER PROPOSES BOTH TO INCREASE FUNDING AND TO DIVERSIFY THE SOURCES, AND MORE CONTROVERSIALLY, TO ALLOW UNIVERSITIES TO SET THEIR OWN FEES. AT THE SAME TIME, IT CONTINUES TO RELY ON AN ACCOUNTABILITY AND REGULATORY BUREAUCRACY, AND INCENTIVE FUNDING, TO ENCOURAGE ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND TO EXPAND ACCESS TO UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS.DOWNLOAD

									DOWNLOAD A PDF (2MB)IT’S A FAMILIAR IF NOT FULLY EXPLAINED PARADIGM. A “WORLD CLASS UNIVERSITY” (WCU) IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE HIGHLY RANKED RESEARCH OUTPUT, A CULTURE OF EXCELLENCE, GREAT FACILITIES, AND A BRAND NAME THAT TRANSCENDS NATIONAL BORDERS. BUT PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, THE PARTICULAR INSTITUTION NEEDS TO SIT IN THE UPPER ECHELONS OF ONE OR MORE WORLD RANKINGS GENERATED EACH YEAR BY NON-PROFIT AND FOR-PROFIT ENTITIES. THAT IS THE ULTIMATE PROOF FOR MANY GOVERNMENT MINISTERS AND FOR MUCH OF THE GLOBAL HIGHER EDUCATION COMMUNITY. OR IS IT? IT IS NOT THAT CURRENT RANKINGS ARE NOT USEFUL AND INFORMATIVE. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THEY REPRESENT A VERY NARROW BAND OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A LEADING, OR WHAT MIGHT BE BEST CALLED A “FLAGSHIP” UNIVERSITY WITHIN A REGION, WITHIN A NATION. FURTHER, WCU ADVOCATES DO NOT PROVIDE MUCH GUIDANCE, OR KNOWLEDGE, ON WHAT ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIORS AND METHODS CAN LEAD TO GREATER PRODUCTIVITY IN RESEARCH, TEACHING, AND PUBLIC SERVICE THAT CAN BEST HELP UNIVERSITIES MEET THE NEEDS OF THE SOCIETIES THEY MUST SERVE. IN THIS ESSAY I ATTEMPT TO ADVOCATE THE NOTION OF THE FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY AS A MORE RELEVANT IDEAL -- A MODEL FOR PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS, AND PERHAPS SOME PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS, ONE THAT COULD REPLACE, OR PERHAPS SUPPLEMENT AND ALTER THE PERCEPTIONS, BEHAVIORS, AND GOALS OF MINISTRIES AND UNIVERSITIES IN THEIR DRIVE FOR STATUS AND INFLUENCE ON SOCIETY. IT IS A MODEL THAT DOES NOT IGNORE INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS OF EXCELLENCE FOCUSED LARGELY ON RESEARCH PRODUCTIVITY, BUT IS GROUNDED IN NATIONAL AND REGIONAL SERVICE, AND WITH A SPECIFIC SET OF CHARACTERISTICS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THAT, ADMITTEDLY, DO NOT LEND THEMSELVES TO RANKING REGIMES. INDEED, ONE GOAL HERE IS TO ARTICULATE A PATH, USING THE LANGUAGE OF THE FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY, THAT DE-EMPHASIZES RANKINGS AND THAT HELPS BROADEN THE FOCUS BEYOND RESEARCH TO RELEVANCY AND RESPONSIBILITY. FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITIES ARE RESEARCH-INTENSIVE INSTITUTIONS, OR IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING SO, BUT HAVE WIDER RECOGNIZED GOALS. THE GREAT CHALLENGE FOR THE NETWORK OF UNIVERSITIES THAT ARE TRULY LEADERS IN THEIR OWN NATIONAL HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS IS TO SHAPE THEIR MISSIONS AND, ULTIMATELY, TO MEANINGFULLY EXPAND THEIR ROLE IN THE SOCIETIES THAT GAVE THEM LIFE AND PURPOSE.  THE FLAGSHIP UNIVERSITY PROFILE EXPLORED HERE INCLUDES AN OUTLINE OF MISSION, CULTURE, AND OPERATIONAL FEATURES, AND IS INTENDED AS A POSSIBLE CONSTRUCT FOR THIS CAUSE.DOWNLOAD

KEY WAS A PROPOSED TARGET OF AT LEAST 60% OF ALL UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS BEING AT THE UPPER DIVISION LEVEL AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND WHAT BECAME THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. AT THE TIME, APPROXIMATELY 51 PERCENT OF THE INSTRUCTION AT BOTH UC AND THE STATE COLLEGES (CSU) WERE AT THE UPPER DIVISION. IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THERE WAS A HIGH CORRELATION BETWEEN UPPER DIVISION INSTRUCTION AND THE STATUS OF UNDERGRADUATES AS JUNIORS AND SENIORS. THE PLAN, SUBSEQUENT ACTIONS BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS. AND AMENDMENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE, REINFORCE THE GENERAL CONCEPT THAT THE 40/60 RATIO IS A MINIMUM TARGET, WITH THE 40 PERCENT A CEILING, AND THE 60 PERCENT UPPER DIVISION A FLOOR.

IN AN ERA OF MASS HIGHER EDUCATION, THE DEBATE OVER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION HAS RENEWED A PERSISTENT QUESTION WITHIN DEMOCRATIC SOCIETIES: WHO SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A PUBLIC UNIVERSITY EDUCATION? TWO GENERAL THEMES WILL BE DISCUSSED. THE FIRST REFLECTS DIFFERENT STAGES IN THE HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF UC ADMISSIONS. ADMISSIONS HAS MOVED FROM A PROCESS INTENDED TO CONSIDER A LARGE NUMBER OF FACTORS FOR PROVIDING ACCESS, TO A MORE RIGID SYSTEM THAT INCLUDES THE ADOPTION OF STANDARDIZED TESTS BEGINNING IN THE 1960S, AND NOW FULL-CIRCLE TOWARD A MORE DYNAMIC PROCESS - YET WITHOUT THE TOOL OF RACE AND GENDER PREFERENCES. THE SECOND THEME REVOLVES AROUND THE DEBATE OVER AFFIRMATIVE ACTION AND POINTS TO A SOURCE OF TENSION WITHIN HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEMS: HOW TO DEFINE AND CREATE A MERITOCRACY THAT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDIVIDUALS, WHILE ALSO MEETING THE LARGER NEEDS OF SOCIETY.DOWNLOAD

THE FIRST IS THE UNIVERSITY'S UNUSUAL STATUS AS A CONSTITUTIONALLY DESIGNATED PUBLIC TRUST -- A DESIGNATION SHARED BY ONLY FIVE OTHER MAJOR PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES. THE SECOND IS THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S TRADITION OF SHARED-GOVERNANCE: THE CONCEPT THAT FACULTY SHOULD SHARE IN THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR GUIDING THE OPERATION AND MANAGEMENT OF THE UNIVERSITY, WHILE PRESERVING THE AUTHORITY OF THE UNIVERSITY'S GOVERNING BOARD, THE REGENTS, TO ULTIMATELY SET POLICY. BOTH OF THESE ORGANIZATIONAL FEATURES OF CALIFORNIA'S LAND-GRANT UNIVERSITY, COMBINED WITH A MASSIVE INVESTMENT BY TAX PAYERS TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT AND ACADEMIC PROGRAMS, HAS RESULTED IN A UNIVERSITY ENTERPRISE OF INTERNATIONAL DISTINCTION AND VITAL SERVICE TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA.

JOY ROHDE|"JOY ROHDE IS AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S GERALD R. FORD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY. SHE IS A HISTORIAN WHO WORKS AT THE INTERSECTION OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY STUDIES, U.S. INTELLECTUAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY, AND THE HISTORY OF U.S. FOREIGN RELATIONS.
ROHDE IS INTERESTED BROADLY IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND STATE POWER. HER FIRST BOOK, ARMED WITH EXPERTISE: THE MILITARIZATION OF AMERICAN SOCIAL RESEARCH DURING THE COLD WAR (CORNELL, 2013), INVESTIGATES THE COLD WAR ORIGINS AND CONTEMPORARY CONSEQUENCES OF THE PENTAGON’S SOCIAL RESEARCH CONTRACTING SYSTEM.
ROHDE’S CURRENT BOOK PROJECT, PEOPLE OF THE MACHINE: SOCIAL SCIENCE, COMPUTERS, AND THE COLD WAR ECLIPSE OF AUTONOMY, IS A HISTORY OF CURRENT EFFORTS TO MANAGE SOCIETY AND POLITICS WITH COMPUTERS. TYPICAL ACCOUNTS OF TODAY’S PREDICTIVE POLICY SYSTEMS LOCATE THEIR ROOTS IN RECENT ADVANCES IN BIG DATA AND MACHINE LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES. PEOPLE OF THE MACHINE SHOWS THAT THE ASPIRATION TO MANAGE POLITICS VIA COMPUTERS ARE ROOTED COLD WAR ERA U.S ANXIETIES AND AMBITIONS. BETWEEN THE 1950S AND THE 1980S, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS EXPERTS JOINED FORCES WITH COMPUTER ENGINEERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS IN A BID TO MAKE POLITICAL SCIENCE SCIENTIFIC AND FOREIGN POLICY PREDICTABLE. BUT THEY ALSO WORRIED THAT THEIR PROJECTS CEDED TOO MUCH INTELLECTUAL AUTONOMY AND POLITICAL AGENCY TO MACHINES AND RECAPITULATED THE RACIALLY DISCRIMINATORY LOGICS OF U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY. PEOPLE OF THE MACHINE USES HISTORY TO DEEPEN AND CLARIFY THE POLITICAL AND INTELLECTUAL STAKES OF CONTEMPORARY COMPUTATIONAL GOVERNANCE PROJECTS. IT SHOWS THAT THE QUEST TO DEPOLITICIZE BEHAVIORAL KNOWLEDGE AND PUBLIC POLICY THROUGH TECHNOLOGY HAS LONG BEEN AN AMBIVALENT POLITICAL AGENDA. BENEATH DEBATES OVER RACIAL BIASES IN ALGORITHMS AND THE THREAT OF MISINFORMATION POSED BY GENERATIVE AI ARE DEEP ANXIETIES ABOUT EXPERTS’ AND CITIZENS’ INTELLECTUAL AND POLITICAL AGENCY IN AN INCREASINGLY FRACTURED AND PERSISTENTLY UNEQUAL MASS POLITY AND INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL SYSTEM.
AT MICHIGAN, ROHDE DIRECTS THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND SOCIETY PROGRAM AND IS A FACULTY AFFILIATE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HISTORY AND THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND PUBLIC POLICY PROGRAM.
IN 2020-21, ROHDE WAS A MEMBER IN THE SCHOOL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE AT THE INSTITUTE FOR ADVANCED STUDY, WITH SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE CARNEGIE CORPORATION OF NEW YORK. HER WORK HAS ALSO BEEN SUPPORTED BY THE MAX PLANCK INSTITUTE FOR THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE AND THE JEFFERSON SCHOLARS FOUNDATION NATIONAL FELLOW PROGRAM.

SUCH DIVERGENT CHANGES ARE PARTICULARLY CHALLENGING TO IMPLEMENT BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE NOT ONLY BREAKING WITH EXISTING NORMS, BUT ALSO CONVINCING OTHERS TO RALLY BEHIND THE CHANGE. PROFESSOR BATTILANA’S RESEARCH AIMS TO ELUCIDATE WHAT IT TAKES TO INITIATE DIVERGENT CHANGE, AND HOW TO SUCCEED IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION. TO DO SO, SHE HAS DEVELOPED TWO STREAMS OF RESEARCH THAT ADDRESS DIVERGENT CHANGE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF ANALYSIS. THE FIRST FOCUSES ON UNDERSTANDING THE CONDITIONS THAT ENABLE INDIVIDUALS TO INITIATE AND IMPLEMENT DIVERGENT CHANGE WITHIN THEIR ORGANIZATIONS. THE SECOND EXAMINES HOW ORGANIZATIONS THEMSELVES CAN DIVERGE FROM DEEPLY-SEATED ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS, WHICH, AS THEY BECOME TAKEN-FOR-GRANTED OVER TIME, PRESCRIBE THE STRUCTURES AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS THAT ORGANIZATIONS IN A GIVEN SECTOR OUGHT TO ADOPT. STUDIES IN THIS STREAM REVEAL THE ROLE OF HYBRID ORGANIZING IN THIS PROCESS—DEFINED AS THE ACTIVITIES, STRUCTURES, PROCESSES AND MEANINGS BY WHICH ORGANIZATIONS MAKE SENSE OF AND COMBINE MULTIPLE ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS. PROFESSOR BATTILANA'S RESEARCH FOCUSES ON A SPECIFIC INSTANCE OF HYBRID ORGANIZING—SOCIAL ENTERPRISES—THAT DIVERGE FROM THE ESTABLISHED ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS OF BOTH TYPICAL CORPORATIONS AND TYPICAL NOT-FOR-PROFITS BY COMBINING ASPECTS OF BOTH AT THEIR CORE.

					WORKING PAPER (JANUARY 2020)CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS IN RIVERS, LAKES, AND HARBORS AROUND THE WORLD RESULT IN DIMINISHED ECOLOGICAL HEALTH, DEGRADATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES, ECONOMIC LOSSES, AND, IN RARE CASES, IMPACTS TO HUMAN HEALTH. DESPITE THE ONGOING INTEREST IN THE CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS IN RIVERS AND HARBORS, LITTLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CONTAMINATED SITES WORLDWIDE. MUCH OF THE DIFFICULTY IN ADVANCING THIS CAUSE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE HIGH COST OF SEDIMENT CLEANUPS AND THE DIFFICULTY IN ASSIGNING FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COST OF THE CLEANUP. SIMPLE SCHEMES DEPENDENT ON IDENTIFYING POLLUTERS ARE FRAUGHT WITH UNDERLYING COMPLEXITY. MORE ELABORATE APPROACHES TIED IN WITH WATERFRONT REDEVELOPMENT SHOW SOME PROMISE BUT ARE YET TO BE APPLIED ROUTINELY. NEW ADVANCES IN THE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW SEDIMENTS MAY, OR MAY NOT, FACTOR INTO CIRCULARITY POSE NEW CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO COMPLEMENT NEW FUNDING PARADIGMS. THE MOST PROMISING POSSIBILITIES FOR ACHIEVING CIRCULARITY IN SEDIMENT MANAGEMENT LIE IN A KIND OF “PUNCTUATED CIRCULARITY,” WHICH REQUIRES IDIOSYNCRATIC, PROJECT-BASED BENEFICIAL USE OPPORTUNITIES. HOWEVER, THESE IDEAL SITUATIONS ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN RARE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE, WITHOUT ADVANCEMENTS IN TECHNOLOGY AND REGULATORY APPROACHES, AS WELL AS DEVELOPMENT OF MARKET DEMAND FOR THE PRODUCTS MADE FROM CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (NOVEMBER 2018)CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS POSE SIGNIFICANT ECOLOGICAL AND HEALTH THREATS IN PORTS AND HARBORS AROUND THE WORLD. YET THERE IS SURPRISINGLY LITTLE PROGRESS TOWARDS CLEANUP IN MOST COUNTRIES. THE U.S. COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION, AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 (CERCLA OR SUPERFUND LAW) FACILITATES CLEANUP PROJECTS BUT THEY OFTEN SUFFER LENGTHY DELAYS NONETHELESS. PARTICIPANTS DEBATE RELATIVE RESPONSIBILITY OVER COST SHARES. PROJECT FINANCE IS OFTEN INSUFFICIENT, IN PART BECAUSE RESOURCES ARE DIVERTED BY ADVERSARIAL LEGALISM (SPADARO AND ROSENTHAL 2003, KAGAN 2001).
TECHNOLOGIES OF SEDIMENT REMEDIATION (E.G., PRECISION DREDGING, ENGINEERED CAP PLACEMENT, NATURAL ATTENUATION) CAN NOW ADDRESS EVEN THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CONTAMINATION. THESE INNOVATIONS ALLOW INCREASING ECONOMIES OF OPERATION AND SIMPLIFICATION OF REMEDIATION DESIGN. APPLYING THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN RISK-BASED PROPORTIONS HAS PRODUCED SIGNIFICANT SUCCESSES, BUT FAR TOO FEW GIVEN THE ENORMITY OF THE CHALLENGE WORLDWIDE. WITHOUT INNOVATIONS IN FUNDING, IMPROVED PROJECT COORDINATION, AND COHERENT WATERFRONT PLANNING, GREATER PROGRESS WILL REMAIN DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE.
WE ANALYZE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN WATERWAY CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATED SEDIMENTS AND WATERFRONT REDEVELOPMENT. USING EXAMPLES FROM NORTH AMERICA, WE EVALUATE POSSIBLE CHANGES IN FUNDING PARADIGMS THAT, IF IMPLEMENTED, COULD ACCELERATE RECLAMATION AND REMEDIATION. WE QUESTION THE EFFICACY OF THE 100-PERCENT-POLLUTER-PAYS MODEL CURRENTLY EMPLOYED IN CLEANUPS UNDER THE SUPERFUND PROGRAM AND STATE-EQUIVALENT MODELS. DESPITE ITS COMPENSATORY LOGIC, POLLUTER-PAYS HAS DIFFICULTY SECURING POLLUTERS’ PARTICIPATION AND ATTRIBUTING PROPORTIONS OF CONTAMINATION TO ORIGINAL SOURCES.
FURTHER, HISTORIC POLLUTERS OFTEN LACK ROOTS IN THE PRESENT-DAY COMMUNITY, AIMING PRIMARILY TO MINIMIZE THEIR FINANCIAL EXPOSURE. BY CONTRAST, LONGER-TERM INTERESTS IN WATERWAYS AND ON THE WATERFRONT—E.G. MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS, PORT AUTHORITIES, AND COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS—CAN PLAY LEADERSHIP ROLES VIA PLANNING, DEVELOPMENT REGULATION, AND UPLANDS REMEDIATION. THOUGH THESE ENTITIES OUGHT BEAR NO MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE OF THE COSTS, THEY SHOULD HELP COORDINATE THE PROCESS WHENEVER POSSIBLE, GIVEN THEIR NATURALLY OCCURRING STAKES IN CLEANUP AND REVITALIZATION.
WE PROPOSE NEW ROLES FOR CLEANUP AUTHORITIES AND NEW STRUCTURES IN PROJECT-FINANCE. TAX-INCREMENT INVESTMENT AND OTHER APPROACHES CAN SALVAGE PUBLIC VALUE AND LIMIT WINDFALLS FOR SPECULATORS. BETTER FUNDING AND PLANNING METHODS ENHANCE LOCAL CONTROL OVER THESE PROJECTS AND THEIR OUTCOMES. IMPORTANTLY, NEW APPROACHES CAN REDUCE LEVELS OF COMMUNITY DISPLACEMENT, AS PROPERTY VALUES RISE WHEN CLEANUP SUCCEEDS.
WITHOUT SUCH COORDINATION OF WATERWAY-WATERFRONT CLEANUP AND REDEVELOPMENT IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST, SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES ARE LOST. THROUGH ENLIGHTENED PRACTICES, PERHAPS SPURRED BY POSITIVE REGULATION AND NEGOTIATED SOLUTIONS EMPHASIZING LOCAL CONSTITUENCIES, GREATER NUMBERS OF EFFECTIVE CLEANUP PROJECTS PROVIDING MEANINGFUL COMMUNITY BENEFITS BECOME POSSIBLE.

					WORKING PAPER (MAY 2017)A SERIES OF MUNICIPAL BANKRUPTCIES ACROSS THE UNITED STATES DURING AND AFTER THE FINANCIAL CRISIS OF 2007-2008 REVEALED THE NEED FOR A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MANY FACTORS THAT SHAPE CITIES’ FISCAL OPERATING ENVIRONMENTS AND SOLVENCY CONDITIONS. THE LARGER PROJECT THIS STUDY IS PART OF FOCUSES ON THE ROLE OF REAL ESTATE PRICE CHANGES IN THE SPENDING AND REVENUES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, EXAMINING SPECIFICALLY THE ISSUE OF IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE AT CITY HALL. WE KNOW THAT PROPERTY VALUE CHANGES CAN INFLUENCE REVENUE EXPECTATIONS, AND ASK WHETHER PERCEPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE GROWTH CONDITIONS MAY INCREASE PROPENSITY TO COMMIT TO SPENDING REVENUE THAT MIGHT NOT MATERIALIZE. ONE UNDERSTUDIED ASPECT OF THIS HYPOTHESIS IS THE WAY IN WHICH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF VARIOUS STRUCTURES PROCESS INFORMATION ABOUT LOCAL REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS AND REVENUE EXPECTATIONS. IN WORK COMPLETED RECENTLY, WE ANALYZED HOW CITY COUNCILS AND FISCAL MANAGERS LEARN ABOUT REAL ESTATE MARKET CONDITIONS. WE FOUND THAT CITIES SEE THEMSELVES AS BUDGETING CONSERVATIVELY, AND THAT THE HOUSING BOOM AND BUST WAS SECONDARY TO DECLINES IN SALES TAX AND OTHER REVENUES DURING THE RECESSION. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXTEND THE INQUIRY TO COVER THE BANKRUPTCIES OF SAN BERNARDINO, VALLEJO, AND STOCKTON, CA. WE EXPLORE THESE CASES RELYING UPON CONTEMPORANEOUS NEWS REPORTS AND COMMENTARIES, AS WELL AS BACKGROUND SOURCES PROVIDING MUNICIPAL HISTORY. WHILE EXUBERANCE MAY SET THE STAGE FOR THE VERY EXTREME POLICY CHOICE TO SEEK CHAPTER 9 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, WE FIND THAT THE PERCEPTIONS OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATORS AND LAWMAKERS RELATIVE TO ECONOMIC GROWTH AND REVENUE EXPECTATIONS ALONE WERE LIKELY NOT SUFFICIENT TO PREDICT, OR EXPLAIN, THESE CASES. INSTEAD, A NUMBER OF POLITICAL, BUDGETARY, AND FINANCIAL FACTORS MUST COINCIDE IN ORDER TO PLACE LEADERS AND MANAGERS INTO THE KIND OF PREDICAMENTS WHICH PLACE BANKRUPTCY ON THE TABLE AS A RATIONAL, IF UNAPPETIZING, OPTION. DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (NOVEMBER 2016)NONPROFIT HOUSING DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATIONS IN THE U.S. HAVE PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVISION FOR DECADES, BUT ARE NOW ENCOUNTERING A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES, SOME OF WHICH ARE ARISING WITHIN THE ORGANIZATIONS, WHILE OTHERS STEM FROM CHANGES IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THEY CARRY OUT THEIR WORK.

CLOCK   OFFICE HOURSBY APPOINTMENTWORKING PAPER: (JUNE 2020) (JUNE 2020)THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A PUBLIC AGENCY’S MANAGERIAL DECISION INTENDED TO PROMOTE BIODIVERSITY ON THE LANDS THAT IT OWNS. THE AGENCY IS THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT (EBMUD) THAT PROVIDES WATER TO MOST OF THE EASTERN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. IN THE 1940S, IT PLANTED NON-NATIVE MONTEREY PINES ON A 366 ACRE PARCEL BY THE SAN PABLO RESERVOIR REFERRED TO AS THE HORSE-LOGGING AREA. LATE IN THAT CENTURY, IT DECIDED THAT THE NONNATIVE MONTEREY PINES WERE NOT CONSISTENT WITH ITS GOAL OF PROMOTING BIODIVERSITY ON THE LANDS THAT IT STEWARDS, AND THAT THESE LANDS SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO RETURN GRADUALLY AND NATURALLY TO THEIR NATIVE OAK WOODLAND. BY THE TURN OF THE CENTURY, MANY OF THE MONTEREY PINES WERE WEAK AND DYING. STARTING IN 2002, EBMUD ALLOWED THESE LANDS TO BE REGULARLY SURVEYED TO ASSESS THE BREEDING BIRD POPULATION IN THEM. THIS PAPER ANALYZES THE SURVEY DATA FROM 2002-2018 TO CONSIDER HOW THE BIRD POPULATION HAS CHANGED AND IF THE CHANGE IS ONE THAT PROMOTES BIODIVERSITY. THE PAPER FINDS THAT BIODIVERSITY HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY BY MULTIPLE MEASURES. THE PAPER REJECTS TWO ALTERNATIVE HYPOTHESES TO EXPLAIN THE BIODIVERSITY INCREASE: (1) THAT IT COULD BE PART OF A BROADER REGIONAL TREND OF AVIAN BIODIVERSITY INCREASE, AND (2) THAT IT COULD BE AN ARTIFACT OF THE SURVEY METHODOLOGY. EBMUD’S DECISION TO ALLOW THESE LANDS TO RETURN GRADUALLY TO THEIR NATIVE VEGETATION WAS EFFECTIVE; IT HAS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN AVIAN BIODIVERSITY. THIS INCREASE INCLUDES THE PRESENCE IN 2010-2018 OF IMPORTANT SPECIES THAT WERE NOT PRESENT IN 2002-2009, INCLUDING MIGRATORY SPECIES LIKE THE OLIVE-SIDED FLYCATCHER, ASH-THROATED FLYCATCHER, AND BLACK-HEADED GROSBEAK. MORE GENERALLY, THE EVIDENCE IN THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE IDEA THAT NATIVE VEGETATION PROMOTES BIODIVERSITY.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (NOVEMBER 2005)
	WE BEGAN THIS RESEARCH WITH TWO OVERLAPPING OBJECTIVES. THE FIRST, AND OF MOST GENERAL
	ACADEMIC INTEREST, IS TO GAIN INSIGHT ABOUT THE FOLLOWING PUZZLE: WHY HAS THERE BEEN
	ESSENTIALLY NIL IMPLEMENTATION OF ANY OF THE INSTITUTIONAL IDEAS IN THE ECONOMICS LITERATURE
	FOR IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF PUBLIC GOODS DECISIONS? THESE IDEAS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED
	AND REFINED IN LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF ACADEMIC ARTICLES OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS, MANY OF
	THEM HAVE UNDERGONE EXTENSIVE LABORATORY TESTING, AND WE HAVE AN EXTENSIVE NETWORK OF
	PUBLIC POLICY PRACTITIONERS AND ACADEMICS THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO HELP BRING THEM INTO
	PRACTICE. THE SECOND OBJECTIVE IS MORE SPECIFIC AND OF IMMEDIATE POLICY RELEVANCE: TO
	UNDERSTAND IF THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE FEDERAL LEGAL
	SERVICES CORPORATION (LSC) BY IMPROVING ITS DECISIONS ABOUT ITS OWN INTERNAL PUBLIC
	GOODS, LARGELY THE PROVISION OF INFORMATION TO ATTORNEYS THAT DIRECTLY SERVICE THE ELIGIBLE
	LOW-INCOME POPULATION. PROVIDING THESE PUBLIC GOODS REQUIRES LOCATING, CUSTOMIZING,
	SYNTHESIZING, AND CREATING DOCUMENTS AND TEMPLATES, DOING RESEARCH, LEADING TRAINING, AND
	ANSWERING QUESTIONS. WE HOPE THAT OUR JOINT CONSIDERATION OF THESE TWO OBJECTIVES MIGHT
	BE BENEFICIAL TO EACH: IDENTIFYING PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE PUBLIC GOODS LITERATURE MAY
	BENEFIT THE LSC, AND A CASE-STUDY OF LSC MAY IDENTIFY GENERAL CHALLENGES THAT PUBLIC
	GOODS MECHANISM LITERATURE SHOULD ADDRESS.DOWNLOAD

	THERE IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN VIRTUAL CONSENSUS AMONG ECONOMISTS THAT MANY AGRICULTURAL
	CROP SUPPORT PROGRAMS CAUSE INEFFICIENCY. EQUALLY TRUE, ECONOMISTS ALSO KNOW THAT WHENEVER
	THERE IS INEFFICIENCY, THERE IS ""ROOM FOR A DEAL"" THAT MITIGATES IT. HOWEVER, THE STANDARD
	POLITICAL EXPLANATIONS FOR THE PERSISTENCE OF THESE INEFFICIENT PROGRAMS RELY ON THE STRENGTH OF
	THE FARM LOBBY RELATIVE TO THE DIFFUSE AND DIFFICULT-TO-ORGANIZE CONSUMERS THAT PAY FOR THEM.
	THIS IS UNSATISFACTORY BECAUSE, BY THE LOGIC OF ECONOMICS, THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A DEAL
	THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE FARM LOBBY IN EXCHANGE FOR SHEDDING THE INEFFICIENT PROGRAMS. IF THE
	FARM LOBBY COULD ITSELF BENEFIT, THEN WE HAVE NO EXPLANATION FOR THE PERSISTENCE OF THE
	INEFFICIENT PROGRAMS. I EXAMINE THIS PUZZLE, AND CONCLUDE THAT INCREASED POLITICAL
	SOPHISTICATION ON THE PART OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMISTS COULD HAVE A HIGH SOCIAL PAYOFF IN TERMS
	OF REDUCED PROGRAM INEFFICIENCIES OVER TIME.DOWNLOAD

THE RESULTS FOR THE US ARE SIMILAR ACROSS THE FOUR STATES SAMPLED CONCERNING CONSUMERS’ WTP FOR THE REDUCTION OF AIR EMISSIONS: PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAY APPROXIMATELY $0.30 PER MONTH FOR A 1% DECREASE IN GHG EMISSIONS. SECOND, THE AVERAGE CONSUMER EXPRESSES A NEGATIVE PREFERENCE FOR INCREASES IN NUCLEAR POWER IN THE FUEL MIX IN BOTH COUNTRIES. JAPANESE CONSUMERS HAVE A STRONGER AVERSION TO NUCLEAR ENERGY THAN US CONSUMERS. THIRD, US AND JAPANESE CONSUMERS WILL PAY MORE FOR EMISSIONS REDUCTION WITH THE USE OF RENEWABLE SOURCES.

WE ALSO CARRY OUT A COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ACROSS FOUR US STATES. WE FIND THAT ON AVERAGE US CONSUMERS ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO FUEL COST REDUCTIONS AND ALTERNATIVE FUEL STATION AVAILABILITY THAN ARE JAPANESE CONSUMERS. WITH REGARD TO THE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS ACROSS THE FOUR US STATES, CONSUMERS’ WTP FOR A FUEL COST REDUCTION IN CALIFORNIA IS CONSIDERABLY GREATER THAN IN THE OTHER THREE STATES. WE USE THE ESTIMATES OBTAINED IN THE DISCRETE CHOICE ANALYSIS TO EXAMINE THE EV/PHEV MARKET SHARES UNDER SEVERAL SCENARIOS. IN A BASE CASE SCENARIO WITH RELATIVELY REALISTIC ATTRIBUTE LEVELS, CONVENTIONAL GASOLINE VEHICLES STILL DOMINATE BOTH IN THE US AND JAPAN. HOWEVER, IN AN INNOVATION SCENARIO WITH A SIGNIFICANT PURCHASE PRICE REDUCTION, WE OBSERVE A HIGH PENETRATION OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES BOTH IN THE US AND JAPAN. WE ILLUSTRATE THE POTENTIAL USE OF A DISCRETE CHOICE ANALYSIS FOR FORWARD-LOOKING POLICY ANALYSIS, WITH THE FUTURE OPPORTUNITY TO COMPARE ITS PREDICTIONS AGAINST ACTUAL REVEALED CHOICES. IN THIS CASE, INCREASED PURCHASE PRICE SUBSIDIES ARE LIKELY TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE MARKET SHARES OF ALTERNATIVE FUEL VEHICLES.DOWNLOAD

FRIEDMAN, LEE. REPORT ISSUED JOINTLY BY NEXT 10 AND THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, JULY 2, 2013
	TO REACH ITS 2050 GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION GOAL, CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY MUST BECOME CLEANER AND SOME ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOW FOSSIL-­‐FUELED MUST RUN PARTIALLY OR FULLY ON THE CLEANER ELECTRICITY—A PROCESS TERMED ELECTRIFICATION.  THIS PAPER RECOMMENDS PRICING POLICY REFORMS THAT WILL HELP TO MAKE DECARBONIZATION AND ELECTRIFICATION DECISIONS EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY. ITS EMPHASIS IS ON BETTER ALIGNMENT OF PRICES WITH SOCIAL COSTS. BUT PARTICIPATION OF MANY OTHER JURISDICTIONS BESIDES CALIFORNIA IS ALSO NECESSARY FOR MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE EFFICIENTLY.  THEREFORE CALIFORNIA POLICYMAKERS SHOULD LOOK FAVORABLY UPON LINKAGE OF ITS CAP-­‐AND-­‐TRADE PROGRAM WITH JURISDICTIONS LIKE QUEBEC THAT ADOPT COMPARABLE GOALS AND RULES.  POLICYMAKERS SHOULD ALSO ACT SOON TO CLARIFY STATE EFFORTS TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS BEYOND THE 2020 MANDATE OF AB 32—OTHERWISE, THE UNCERTAINTY LOWERS EXPECTED FUTURE ALLOWANCE PRICES AND DETERS INVESTMENTS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOR CLEANER GENERATION, FACTORIES, BUILDINGS, AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE. SUBSTANTIAL  REFORM  IS ALSO NEEDED  WITH THE RETAIL  PRICING  OF ELECTRICITY. RESTRICTIONS  HELD OVER FROM  THE  STATE’S  2001  ELECTRICITY  CRISIS  ARE  PREVENTING  10  MILLION CALIFORNIA  RESIDENCES  FROM RECEIVING ANY CARBON PRICE SIGNAL AT ALL, DESPITE THE FACT THAT THEY WOULD BE COMPENSATED FOR THIS PRICE INCREASE WITH DIVIDENDS. CALIFORNIA ALSO NEEDS TO TRANSITION ITS ELECTRICITY CUSTOMERS ON TO TIME-­‐VARYING  RATES THAT REFLECT THE LARGE SOCIAL COST DIFFERENCES OF PROVIDING SERVICE AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY. THE PREVAILING TIME-­‐INVARIANT SYSTEM IS AN INEFFICIENT IMPEDIMENT TO VEHICLE ELECTRIFICATION—WHILE IT ONLY COSTS ABOUT $.05 PER KWH TO PROVIDE OFFPEAK ELECTRICITY WHEN RECHARGING IS CONVENIENT, MANY CUSTOMERS FACE RATES THAT ARE MORE THAN 6 TIMES THIS COST. THE SAME  MISALIGNMENT  OF  RATES  WITH  COSTS  IS  ALSO HINDERING  THE  DEVELOPMENT  OF  GRID  STORAGE IMPORTANT TO MANAGE INCREASED USE OF INTERMITTENT RENEWABLE GENERATION. IT IS HINDERING PARTICIPATION  IN DEMAND  RESPONSE  PROGRAMS  THAT  AVOID INEFFICIENT,  HIGH-­‐EMISSION PEAK GENERATION,  FACILITATE INCREASED RENEWABLE GENERATION,  AND CAN BE USED TO PROVIDE BETTER AND CLEANER ANCILLARY  SERVICES.  TIME-­‐VARYING  PRICES COMMENSURATE WITH COSTS OF SERVICE WOULD NOT ONLY FIX THESE  ISSUES,  BUT THEY WOULD  ENCOURAGE  THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENABLING  TECHNOLOGY  TO FURTHER  IMPROVE  ALL  OF THESE  GHG-­‐REDUCING  ACTIONS.  IMPORTANT FAIRNESS  CONCERNS  ABOUT  TIME-­‐ VARYING RATES CAN BE ADDRESSED BY SEVERAL RATE DESIGN METHODS, INCLUDING HOOP (HOUSEHOLD ON AND  OFF  PEAK)  PRICING  THAT  COMBINES  TIME-­‐VARYING 
	MARGINAL-­‐COST  BASED  VOLUMETRIC  RATES  WITH  A SYSTEM OF NON-­‐DISTORTING GRADUATED FEES.DOWNLOAD

	THE EFFICIENT REDUCTION OF GHG EMISSIONS REQUIRES APPROPRIATE RETAIL PRICING OF OFF-PEAK
	ELECTRICITY. HOWEVER, OFF-PEAK ELECTRICITY FOR RESIDENTIAL CONSUMERS IS PRICED AT 331% ABOVE ITS MARGINAL COST
	IN THE UNITED STATES AS A WHOLE (JUNE 2009). EVEN FOR THE 1% OF RESIDENCES THAT ARE ON SOME FORM OF
	TIME-OF- USE (TOU) RATE SCHEDULE, THE OFF-PEAK RATE IS ALMOST THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE MARGINAL
	COST. A BARRIER TO MARGINAL-COST BASED TOU RATES IS THAT LESS THAN 9% OF U.S. HOUSEHOLDS HAVE THE
	“SMART” METERS IN PLACE THAT CAN MEASURE AND RECORD THE TIME OF CONSUMPTION. POLICIES SHOULD BE PUT
	IN PLACE TO ACHIEVE FULL DEPLOYMENT. ANOTHER IMPORTANT BARRIER IS CONSUMER CONCERN ABOUT TOU RATE
	DESIGN. TWO TOU RATE DESIGNS (BASELINE AND TWO-PART TARIFF) ARE DESCRIBED THAT UTILIZE MARGINAL-COST BASED RATES, ENSURE APPROPRIATE COST RECOVERY, AND MINIMIZE BILL CHANGES FROM CURRENT RATE STRUCTURES. A FINAL BARRIER IS TO GET RESIDENCES ON TO THESE RATES.

	JURISDICTIONS ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING REGULATORY  SYSTEMS TO CONTROL  GREEN-
	HOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. SHORT-TERM AND  SOMETIMES LONG-TERM EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS ARE ESTABLISHED,
	AS CALIFORNIA DOES FOR 2020 AND 2050,  BUT LITTLE ATTENTION HAS YET BEEN FOCUSED ON ANNUAL
	EMISSIONS TARGETS FOR THE INTERVENING YEARS. WE DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR  HOW   THESE  ANNUAL
	TARGETS—WHICH WE  COLLECTIVELY TERM  A “COMPLIANCE PATHWAY”—CAN BE SET, AS WELL AS WHAT FLEXIBILITY
	SOURCES SHOULD HAVE TO  ADJUST IN  LIGHT  OF  COST  UNCERTAINTIES. ENVIRONMENTAL  EFFECTIVENESS,
	EFFICIENCY, EQUITY, ADAPTABILITY, AND  ENCOURAGING GLOBAL PARTICIPATION ARE APPROPRIATE CRITERIA BY
	WHICH THESE  INTERTEMPORAL POLICY  ALTERNATIVES SHOULD BE JUDGED.  LIMITED BUT USEFUL KNOWLEDGE
	ABOUT COSTS  LEADS US TO RECOMMEND A COMPLIANCE PATHWAY CHAR- ACTERIZED  BY INCREASING INCREMENTAL
	REDUCTIONS ALONG IT. THIS CAN BE APPROXIMATED BY  DISCRETE   LINEAR   SEGMENTS,  WHICH  MAY   FIT  
	BETTER   WITH  GLOBAL   NEGOTIATIONS. ALTHOUGH THE ABOVE CONCLUSION APPLIES TO ANY LONG-TERM GHG
	REGULATORY  PROGRAM, MANY JURISDICTIONS WILL RELY HEAVILY  ON A CAP-AND-TRADE SYSTEM, AND THE SAME 
	PATH- WAY RECOMMENDATION APPLIES  TO ITS TIME  SCHEDULE OF ALLOWANCES. FURTHERMORE, BORROWING
	CONSTRAINTS IN CAP-AND-TRADE SYSTEMS CAN IMPOSE SUBSTANTIAL UNNECES- SARY COSTS.  TO AVOID  MOST OF
	THESE  COSTS,  WE RECOMMEND THAT  SOURCES BE ALLOWED EARLY USE  OF LIMITED PERCENTAGES  OF
	ALLOWANCES INTENDED FOR FUTURE YEARS.  WE ALSO FIND  THAT  A THREE-YEAR  COMPLIANCE PERIOD  CAN 
	HAVE  SUBSTANTIAL BENEFIT  OVER A ONE- YEAR PERIOD.  © 2010 BY THE ASSOCIATION FOR PUBLIC POLICY

	CALIFORNIA  SHOULD INCLUDE VEHICLE FUELS AS PART  OF A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION CAP-AND-TRADE   PROGRAM.  NUMEROUS  POLITICAL,  ADMINISTRATIVE  AND  ECONOMIC  REASONS  THAT  SUGGEST OTHERWISE ARE CONSIDERED. THEY INCLUDE COMPLIANCE AND ENFORCEMENT CONCERNS, OTHER REGULATORY PROGRAMS  FOR  TRANSPORTATION, BELIEF THAT  GAINS  FROM  INCLUSION WOULD BE  SMALL,  JURISDICTIONAL LINKAGE  ISSUES,  AND  BOTH  POLITICAL  SKEPTICISM  AND  AGENCY  INEXPERIENCE  WITH  MARKET-BASED REGULATION.  HOWEVER, CONSIDERATION  OF MOST OF THESE STRONGLY  FAVORS INCLUSION. INCLUSION ALSO CREATES AN IMPORTANT COMPETITION BETWEEN THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR AND OTHER VEHICLE FUELS TO SHRINK
	EMISSIONS OVER TIME AS THEY VIE TO SEE WHICH CAN MOST SUCCESSFULLY REPLACE ORDINARY GASOLINE AND DIESEL.

	ALTHOUGH MUCH OF WHAT ECONOMISTS WRITE IS ""INSIDE BASEBALL"" — WRITTEN FOR A SMALL AUDIENCE OF SPECIALISTS — ECONOMISTS HAVE MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PUBLIC DEBATE ON A WIDE RANGE OF POLICY ISSUES. WE BELIEVE THAT ANYONE CONCERNED ABOUT THE CENTRAL ISSUES OF THE DAY, WHETHER THEY ARE STUDENTS, POLICYMAKERS, OR OTHER CITIZENS, WOULD BENEFIT FROM HEARING ECONOMISTS DEBATE WHAT SHOULD BE DONE ABOUT PROBLEMS FROM BUDGET BALANCING TO GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT, FROM INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO OUTSOURCING, FROM HEALTH CARE REFORM TO HOW TO PROVIDE OLD AGE SECURITY.
	THE ECONOMISTS' VOICE CREATES A FORUM FOR READABLE IDEAS AND ANALYSIS BY LEADING ECONOMISTS ON VITAL ISSUES OF OUR DAY.

	UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS SOMETIMES ARISE WHEN GOVERNMENTS ATTEMPT TO INTRODUCE COMPETITION. THE PROBLEM CONSIDERED HEREIN IS MARKET POWER AND ITS EXERCISE DURING THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY CRISIS OF 2000–2001. IN INTRODUCING COMPETITION, BOTH TRANSITIONAL AND LONG-RUN OPPORTUNITIES FOR FIRMS TO EXERCISE MARKET POWER MAY ARISE. CALIFORNIA HAD TRANSITIONAL RULES THAT SEVERELY LIMITED PARTICIPATION OF ITS UTILITIES IN FORWARD MARKETS AND ENHANCED THE MARKET POWER OF NEW GENERATING ENTITIES. THE TRANSITIONAL PROBLEMS COULD HAVE BEEN AVOIDED, BUT IN THE LONG-RUN A SMALLER MARKET POWER ISSUE SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO ARISE STOCHASTICALLY. THIS ANALYSIS SUGGESTS A NEW LONG-RUN INSTITUTIONAL POLICY ROLE: CONTINUAL  REGULATORY  OVERSIGHT  OF   AN  INDUSTRY  THAT   COULD  BE   WORKABLY COMPETITIVE MOST OF THE TIME. THIS EXPLAINS WHY AN AGENCY LIKE THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION SHOULD HAVE A PERMANENT OFFICE OF MARKET MONITORING. IT ALSO SUGGESTS WHY, IN SOME ELECTRICITY MARKETS, STOCHASTIC MARKET
	POWER EVENTS MAY ARISE BEFORE CAPACITY GETS STRAINED.DOWNLOAD

	THIS PAPER AIMS TO PROVIDE AN OBJECTIVE HISTORY OF ELECTRICITY RESTRUCTURING IN CALIFORNIA FROM THE MID-1990S TO THE IMMEDIATE END OF THE “CALIFORNIA ENERGY CRISIS” IN JUNE 2001. WE DISCUSS THE RESTRUCTURING DEBATE THAT LED TO THE RESTRUCTURING LAW (AB1890), AND DESCRIBE HOW THE NEW STRUCTURE WORKED AFTER IT TOOK EFFECT IN APRIL 1998. WE DISCUSS THE COURSE OF EVENTS DURING THE CRISIS, AND FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO IT, INCLUDING THE SUPPLY-DEMAND BALANCE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN THE WEST, RISING GAS PRICES, THE COMPLEXITY OF THE MARKET DESIGN, MARKET POWER, AND THE REGULATORY DECISION TO CAP RETAIL BUT NOT WHOLESALE PRICES.

	BEHAVIORAL DECISION THEORY DRAWS ON EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY TO PROVIDE A DESCRIPTIVELY ACCURATE MODEL OF HUMAN BEHAVIOR. IT SHOWS THAT PEOPLE SYSTEMATICALLY VIOLATE THE NORMATIVE ASSUMPTIONS OF ECONOMIC RATIONALITY BY MISCALCULATING PROBABILITIES AND MAKING CHOICES BASED ON ONE-ECONOMIC CRITERIA. BEHAVIORAL DECISION THEORY'S ABILITY TO CAPTURE THE COMPLEXITY OF HUMAN JUDGMENTS AND CHOICES MAKES IT A USEFUL FOUNDATION FOR IMPROVING PUBLIC POLICY ANALYSIS, DESIGN, AND IMPLEMENTATION. ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN 2001, THIS VOLUME SHOWCASES THE RESEARCH OF LEADING SCHOLARS WHO ARE WORKING ON APPLICATIONS OF BEHAVIORAL DECISION THEORY IN DIVERSE POLICY SETTINGS. IT IS DESIGNED TO GIVE POLICY ANALYSTS AND PRACTITIONERS WHO ARE NON-PSYCHOLOGISTS A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF THE COMPLEXITIES OF HUMAN JUDGMENT AND CHOICE, AND SUGGEST HOW TO INTEGRATE BEHAVIORAL DECISION THEORETIC INSIGHTS INTO THE POLICY SCIENCES. THIS INTERDISCIPLINARY VOLUME SHOULD BE INSIGHTFUL AND USEFUL WHEREVER PEOPLE'S JUDGMENTS AND CHOICES MATTER FOR POLICY FORMULATION, ACCEPTANCE, AND EFFECTIVENESS.DOWNLOAD

FRIEDMAN, LEE S. THE MICROECONOMICS OF PUBLIC POLICY ANALYSIS. PRINCETON, NJ: PRINCETON UP, 2002.
	THIS BOOK SHOWS, FROM START TO FINISH, HOW MICROECONOMICS CAN AND SHOULD BE USED IN THE ANALYSIS OF PUBLIC POLICY PROBLEMS. IT IS AN EXCITING NEW WAY TO LEARN MICROECONOMICS, MOTIVATED BY ITS APPLICATION TO IMPORTANT, REAL-WORLD ISSUES. LEE FRIEDMAN'S MODERN REPLACEMENT FOR HIS INFLUENTIAL 1984 WORK NOT ONLY BRINGS THE ISSUES ADDRESSED INTO THE PRESENT BUT DEVELOPS ALL INTERMEDIATE MICROECONOMIC THEORY TO MAKE THIS BOOK ACCESSIBLE TO A MUCH WIDER AUDIENCE.
	FRIEDMAN OFFERS THE MICROECONOMIC TOOLS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND POLICY ANALYSIS OF A WIDE RANGE OF MATTERS OF PUBLIC CONCERN--INCLUDING THE RECENT CALIFORNIA ELECTRICITY CRISIS, WELFARE REFORM, PUBLIC SCHOOL FINANCE, GLOBAL WARMING, HEALTH INSURANCE, DAY CARE, TAX POLICIES, COLLEGE LOANS, AND MASS TRANSIT PRICING. THESE ISSUES ARE SCRUTINIZED THROUGH MICROECONOMIC MODELS THAT IDENTIFY POLICY STRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, AND IDEAS FOR IMPROVEMENTS. EACH CHAPTER BEGINS WITH EXPLANATIONS OF SEVERAL FUNDAMENTAL MICROECONOMIC PRINCIPLES AND THEN DEVELOPS MODELS THAT USE AND PROBE THEM IN ANALYZING SPECIFIC PUBLIC POLICIES.
	THE BOOK HAS TWO PRIMARY AND COMPLEMENTARY GOALS. ONE IS TO DEVELOP SKILLS OF ECONOMIC POLICY ANALYSIS: TO DESIGN, PREDICT THE EFFECTS OF, AND EVALUATE PUBLIC POLICIES. THE OTHER IS TO DEVELOP A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF MICROECONOMICS AS AN ANALYTIC TOOL FOR APPLICATION--ITS STRENGTHS AND EXTENSIONS INTO SUCH ADVANCED TECHNIQUES AS GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM MODELS AND PRICING METHODS FOR NATURAL MONOPOLIES AND ITS WEAKNESSES, SUCH AS BEHAVIORAL INCONSISTENCIES WITH UTILITY-MAXIMIZATION MODELS AND ITS LIMITS IN COMPARING INSTITUTIONAL ALTERNATIVES. THE RESULT IS AN INVALUABLE PROFESSIONAL AND ACADEMIC REFERENCE, ONE WHOSE CLEAR EXPLANATION OF PRINCIPLES AND ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES, AND WEALTH OF CONSTRUCTIVE APPLICATIONS, WILL ENSURE IT A PROMINENT PLACE NOT ONLY ON THE BOOKSHELVES BUT ALSO ON THE DESKS OF STUDENTS AND PROFESSIONALS ALIKE.

A KEY QUESTION FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES IS HOW TO INCREASE BOOSTER VACCINATION RATES, PARTICULARLY AMONG HIGH-RISK GROUPS. WE CONDUCTED A LARGE PREREGISTERED RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL (WITH 57,893 STUDY SUBJECTS) IN A COUNTY HEALTH SYSTEM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA TO TEST THE IMPACT OF PERSONAL REMINDER MESSAGES AND SMALL FINANCIAL INCENTIVES OF $25 ON BOOSTER VACCINATION RATES. WE FOUND THAT REMINDERS INCREASED BOOSTER VACCINATION RATES WITHIN 2 WK BY 0.86 PERCENTAGE POINTS (P = 0.000) OR NEARLY 33% OFF THE CONTROL MEAN OF 2.65%. MONETARY INCENTIVES HAD NO ADDITIONAL IMPACT ON VACCINATION RATES. THE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL OF LOW-COST TARGETED MESSAGES, BUT NOT SMALL FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, TO INCREASE BOOSTER VACCINATION RATES.DOWNLOAD

DURING THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 LOCKDOWNS, THE UNITED NATIONS COINED THE TERM THE SHADOW PANDEMIC TO DESCRIBE THE INCREASE IN GLOBAL VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN. HERE, USING VARIATION IN THE INTENSITY OF GOVERNMENT-MANDATED LOCKDOWNS IN INDIA, WE SHOW THAT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMPLAINTS INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN DISTRICTS WITH THE STRICTEST LOCKDOWN RULES. WE FIND SIMILARLY LARGE INCREASES IN CYBERCRIME COMPLAINTS. HOWEVER, RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT COMPLAINTS DECREASE IN DISTRICTS WITH THE STRICTEST LOCKDOWNS, CONSISTENT WITH DECREASED FEMALE MOBILITY IN PUBLIC SPACES, PUBLIC TRANSPORT AND WORKPLACES WHERE THEY MIGHT BE AT GREATER RISK FOR RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT. MEDIUM-TERM ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT INCREASES IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE COMPLAINTS PERSIST 1 YEAR LATER, WHILE OTHER COMPLAINTS RELATED TO RAPE, SEXUAL ASSAULT AND CYBERCRIMES RETURN TO PRE-LOCKDOWN LEVELS.DOWNLOAD

THE PROGRAMS – ALL VARIANTS OF THE WIDELY-USED COMMUNITY-LED TOTAL SANITATION (CLTS) APPROACH - INCREASE VILLAGE PRIVATE SANITATION COVERAGE IN ALL FOUR LOCATIONS BY 7–39 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

THERE DO NOT APPEAR TO BE FURTHER GAINS BEYOND THIS THRESHOLD. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE LARGE HEALTH BENEFITS TO ACHIEVING COVERAGE LEVELS WELL BELOW THE 100% COVERAGE PUSHED BY THE CLTS MOVEMENT.

YET, THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE ON THE IMPACTS OF THESE POLICIES ON WOMEN IN LOWER-INCOME COUNTRIES, WHERE THERE MAY BE LIMITED SOCIAL SAFETY NETS TO ABSORB THESE SHOCKS. WE CONDUCT A LARGE PHONE SURVEY AND LEVERAGE INDIA’S GEOGRAPHICALLY VARIED CONTAINMENT POLICIES TO ESTIMATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE PANDEMIC AND CONTAINMENT POLICIES AND MEASURES OF WOMEN’S WELL-BEING, INCLUDING MENTAL HEALTH AND FOOD SECURITY. ON AGGREGATE, THE PANDEMIC RESULTED IN DRAMATIC INCOME LOSSES, INCREASES IN FOOD INSECURITY, AND DECLINES IN FEMALE MENTAL HEALTH. WHILE POTENTIALLY CRUCIAL TO STEM THE SPREAD OF COVID-19, THE GREATER PREVALENCE OF CONTAINMENT POLICIES IS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED FOOD INSECURITY, PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN, AND REDUCED FEMALE MENTAL HEALTH. FOR SURVEYED WOMEN, MOVING FROM ZERO TO AVERAGE CONTAINMENT LEVELS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 38% INCREASE IN THE LIKELIHOOD OF REPORTING MORE DEPRESSION, A 73% INCREASE IN REPORTING MORE EXHAUSTION, AND A 44% INCREASE IN REPORTING MORE ANXIETY. WOMEN WHOSE SOCIAL POSITION MAY MAKE THEM MORE VULNERABLE – THOSE WITH DAUGHTERS AND THOSE LIVING IN FEMALE-HEADED HOUSEHOLDS – EXPERIENCE EVEN LARGER DECLINES IN MENTAL HEALTH.DOWNLOAD

WE COLLECT DATA FROM FEMALE SEX WORKERS AND THEIR CLIENTS BEFORE AND AFTER THE CHANGE. WE FIND THAT CRIMINALIZATION INCREASES SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED INFECTIONS AMONG FEMALE SEX WORKERS BY 58 PERCENT, MEASURED BY BIOLOGICAL TESTS. THIS IS DRIVEN BY DECREASED CONDOM ACCESS AND USE.

					WORKING PAPER (AUGUST 2023)ADOLESCENTS IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE ACROSS THE GLOBE. THIS PAPER EVALUATES THE IMPACT OF A RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL THAT OFFERS FEMALES A GOAL SETTING ACTIVITY TO IMPROVE THEIR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES AND OFFERS THEIR MALE PARTNERS A SOCCER INTERVENTION, WHICH EDUCATES AND INSPIRES YOUNG MEN TO MAKE BETTER SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CHOICES. BOTH INTERVENTIONS REDUCE FEMALE REPORTS OF INTIMATE PARTNER VIOLENCE. IMPACTS ARE LARGER AMONG FEMALES WHO WERE ALREADY SEXUALLY ACTIVE AT BASELINE. WE DEVELOP A MODEL TO UNDERSTAND THE MECHANISMS AT PLAY. THE SOCCER INTERVENTION IMPROVES MALE ATTITUDES AROUND VIOLENCE AND RISKY SEXUAL BEHAVIORS. FEMALES IN THE GOAL SETTING ARM TAKE MORE CONTROL OF THEIR SEXUAL AND REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH BY EXITING VIOLENT RELATIONSHIPS. BOTH OF THESE MECHANISMS DRIVE REDUCTIONS IN IPV.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (MARCH 2021)POLICIES THAT IMPROVE EARLY LIFE HUMAN CAPITAL ARE A PROMISING TOOL TO ALTER DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN'S LIFELONG TRAJECTORIES. YET, IN MANY LOW-INCOME COUNTRIES, CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS FACE TRADEOFFS BETWEEN SCHOOLING AND PRODUCTIVE WORK. IF THERE ARE POSITIVE RETURNS TO HUMAN CAPITAL IN CHILD LABOR, THEN CHILDREN WHO RECEIVE GREATER EARLY LIFE INVESTMENTS MAY ATTEND LESS SCHOOL. EXPLOITING EARLY LIFE RAINFALL SHOCKS IN INDIA AS A SOURCE OF EXOGENOUS VARIATION IN EARLY LIFE INVESTMENT, WE SHOW THAT INCREASED EARLY LIFE INVESTMENT REDUCES SCHOOLING IN DISTRICTS WITH HIGH CHILD LABOR. THESE EFFECTS PERSIST AND ARE INTERGENERATIONAL, AFFECTING ADULT HOUSEHOLD CONSUMPTION, AND LEAD TO A DIVERGENCE IN THE NEXT GENERATIONS' EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES.

TODAY THE NMD PROJECT (NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE)-RE-DESIGNATED MD (MISSILE DEFENSE)- WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION- MIGHT WELL, UNLIKE ITS FORERUNNERS, BE PROGRESSIVELY DEPLOYED.

	IMPLEMENTATION OF MANY POLICIES INTENDED TO REDUCE FUELS’ CONTRIBUTION TO GLOBAL WARMING REQUIRE AN ESTIMATE OF THE GLOBAL WARMING INTENSITY (GWI) OF VARIOUS FUELS. DETERMINING THE CLIMATE EFFECT OF A DIRECT SUBSTITUTION OF FUELS IS NOT THE SAME AS DETERMINING THE OFFICIAL VALUE OF EACH FUEL’S GWI USED TO IMPLEMENT THE POLICY. CHOOSING THE SECOND, WHICH DEPENDS IN PART ON ESTIMATES OF THE FIRST AND THEIR INTRINSIC UNCERTAINTY, IS A DECISION THAT SHOULD REFLECT THE SHAPE OF THE PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION OF THE FIRST AND OF THE COST OF ERROR (THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHOSEN VALUE AND THE ‘REAL’ VALUE. DECISION ANALYSIS HELPS CLARIFY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE GWI’S, HOW THEY RELATE TO EACH OTHER, AND HOW STANDARD ENGINEERING PRACTICE LIKE A SAFETY FACTOR APPLIES TO THE REGULATOR’S DECISION.DOWNLOAD

	THIS PAPER WAS COMMISSIONED FOR A PLENARY SESSION AT THE ASSOCIATION FOR CULTURAL ECONOMICS INTERNATIONAL 2008 RESEARCH CONFERENCE RECOGNIZING THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE PUBLICATION OF PATRONS DESPITE THEMSELVES: TAXPAYERS AND ARTS POLICY.  IT PROPOSES FIVE “BIG QUESTIONS” TO WHICH ARTS POLICY RESEARCH SHOULD ATTEND IF CARRIED ON IN THE SPIRIT THAT ANIMATED THE BOOK, NAMELY THAT ARTS POLICY SHOULD SEEK TO GENERATE “MORE, BETTER, ENGAGEMENT BY MORE PEOPLE WITH BETTER ART.”  THE FIVE ISSUES ARE:
	1. WASTE OF CULTURAL RESOURCES REPRESENTED BY WORKS THAT ARE NOT HEARD OR SEEN, SUCH AS UNPERFORMED MUSIC AND WORKS IN RESERVE COLLECTIONS OF MUSEUMS.
	2. DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A WORKABLE BUSINESS MODEL FOR WORKS IN DIGITAL FORM (RECORDINGS, VIDEO, TEXT, ETC.).
	3. INCREASING THE VALUE CREATED BY AMATEUR PARTICIPATION (IN CONTRAST TO PASSIVE CONSUMPTION OF ART PROVIDED BY PROFESSIONALS).
	4. WITHDRAWAL OF ELITES, ESPECIALLY ECONOMIC ELITES, FROM THEIR HISTORIC PARTICIPATION IN ARTS GOVERNANCE AND SUPPORT.
	5. FRAGMENTATION OF COLLECTIVE PATRIMONY AS PEOPLE HAVE FEWER AND FEWER WORKS COMMONLY EXPERIENCED AND ART SERVES NICHE MARKETS.WORKING PAPER: GSPP08-005 (NOVEMBER 2005)
	THOUGH STANDARD ACCOUNTING PRACTICE REQUIRES THAT ALL ASSETS OF A FIRM BE MANIFEST IN ACCOUNTS, AN EXCEPTION TO THIS PRINCIPLE ALLOWS MUSEUMS TO OMIT THEIR ENTIRE COLLECTIONS FROM THEIR BALANCE SHEETS. AS THE COLLECTION OF ANY TOP-RANK MUSEUM HAS MORE VALUE THAN THE REST OF A TYPICAL MUSEUM'S ASSETS PUT TOGETHER, THIS PRACTICE GREATLY OBSTRUCTS GOOD INSTITUTIONAL DECISIONMAKING. THE PRACTICE IS JUSTIFIED BY AN ASSERTION COMMON IN THE MUSEUM COMMUNITY THAT THE COLLECTION IS NOT A FINANCIAL ASSET, NEITHER AVAILABLE FOR SALE NOR OBLIGATION AS A LOAN SECURITY, AND BY A VARIETY OF OTHER ASSERTIONS REGARDING THE COST OF ASSESSING IT. THESE ASSERTIONS ARE SHOWN TO BE CHOICES WITH NO FUNDAMENTAL SUPPORT BEYOND MUSEUM MANAGEMENT COMFORT, OR TO BE ERRONEOUS. 

	THE ALLOCATION OF ARTISTIC PATRIMONY ACROSS MUSEUMS GENERATES A RETURN ON INVESTMENT BELOW 1%, INDICATING THAT THESE ASSETS ARE NOT BEING USED EFFICIENTLY TO CREATE THE BENEFITS MUSEUMS (WHETHER NON-PROFIT OR PUBLIC) ARE SUPPOSED TO PROVIDE: NO OTHER ORGANIZATION WOULD BE ALLOWED TO CONTROL ASSETS WITH SUCH A LOW RATE OF RETURN. CAPITALIZING COLLECTIONS IS PRACTICAL AND WOULD LEAD TO A VARIETY OF BENEFICIAL CHANGES IN MUSEUM PRACTICE, ON THE CRITERION OF INDUCING ""MORE, BETTER, ENGAGEMENT WITH MORE ART BY MORE PEOPLE.""DOWNLOAD

	URBAN WATER PRICING PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE WHETHER CONSUMERS REACT TO THE
	SHAPE OF SUPPLY FUNCTIONS. WE CARRY OUT AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS OF THE INFLUENCE OF PRICE AND PRICE
	STRUCTURE ON RESIDENTIAL WATER DEMAND, USING THE MOST PRICE-DIVERSE, DETAILED, HOUSEHOLD-LEVEL
	WATER DEMAND DATA YET AVAILABLE FOR THIS PURPOSE. WE ADAPT THE HAUSMAN MODEL OF LABOR SUPPLY
	UNDER PROGRESSIVE INCOME TAXATION TO ESTIMATE WATER DEMAND UNDER NON-LINEAR PRICES. OURS IS THE
	FIRST ANALYSIS TO ADDRESS BOTH THE SIMULTANEOUS DETERMINATION OF MARGINAL PRICE AND WATER DEMAND
	UNDER BLOCK PRICING AND THE POSSIBILITY OF ENDOGENOUS PRICE STRUCTURES IN THE CROSS SECTION. IN
	ORDER TO EXAMINE THE POSSIBILITY THAT CONSUMERS FACING BLOCK PRICES ARE MORE PRICE-RESPONSIVE, ALL
	ELSE EQUAL, WE TEST FOR PRICE ELASTICITY DIFFERENCES ACROSS PRICE STRUCTURES. WE FIND THAT
	HOUSEHOLDS FACING BLOCK PRICES ARE MORE SENSITIVE TO PRICE INCREASES THAN HOUSEHOLDS FACING
	UNIFORM MARGINAL PRICES. TESTS FOR ENDOGENOUS PRICE STRUCTURES CANNOT RULE OUT A BEHAVIORAL
	RESPONSE TO THE SHAPE OF SUPPLY, BUT SUGGEST THAT OBSERVED DIFFERENCES IN PRICE ELASTICITY UNDER

	IN THIS PAPER WE EXAMINE HOW ONE MIGHT SYSTEMATICALLY MODEL THE INCIDENCES OF PROPERTY CREATED AND ENFORCED BY TORT LAW AND ANALYZE THEIR EFFECT ON ECONOMIC BEHAVIOR. WE THEN SHOW HOW SUCH A MODEL CAN HELP PROVIDE DEEPER INSIGHTS INTO THE LAW AND ECONOMICS ANALYSIS OF TORT, USING AS AN EXAMPLE THE SEARCH FOR A UNIFIED APPROACH TO ASSESSING COMPENSATION FOR NONPECUNIARY AND PECUNIARY LOSS. THE PAPER IS ORGANIZED AS FOLLOWS. IN SECTION 1, WE PRESENT A LEGAL ANALYSIS OF THE ENTITLEMENT CONFERRED BY TORT LAW. THIS IS THEN FORMALIZED IN SECTION 2 IN AN ECONOMIC MODEL OF THE INCIDENCES OF OWNERSHIP DEFINED AND ENFORCED BY TORT LAW. IN SECTION 3 WE SHOW HOW THIS PERSPECTIVE ON TORT LAW CAN ADD TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE DESIGN AND FUNCTION OF TORTS BY RE-EXAMINING THE LITERATURE ON INSURANCE AND TORT COMPENSATION FOR NONPECUNIARY LOSS.

					WORKING PAPER (JANUARY 2005)
	THERE HAS BEEN A LIVELY DEBATE ABOUT THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE
	ON U.S. AGRICULTURE. MOST OF THE EARLY AGRO-ECONOMIC STUDIES PREDICT LARGE DAMAGES (SEE,
	FOR EXAMPLE, RICHARD M. ADAMS, 1989; HARRY M. KAISER ET AL., 1993; AND ADAMS ET AL.,
	1995). IN AN INNOVATIVE PAPER ROBERT MENDELSOHN, WILLIAM D. NORDHAUS AND DAIGEE SHAW
	(1994) - HEREAFTER MNS - PROPOSE A NEW APPROACH: USING THE VARIATION IN TEMPERATURE AND
	PRECIPITATION ACROSS U.S. COUNTIES TO ESTIMATE A REDUCED FORM HEDONIC EQUATION WITH THE
	VALUE OF FARMLAND AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE. A CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE AND/OR PRECIPITATION
	IS THEN ASSOCIATED WITH A CHANGE IN FARMLAND VALUE WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED AS THE IMPACT OF
	CLIMATE CHANGE. ADAMS ET AL. (1998) CHARACTERIZE THE HEDONIC APPROACH AS A SPATIAL ANALOGUE
	APPROACH, AND ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ""THE STRENGTH OF THE SPATIAL ANALOGUE APPROACH IS THAT
	STRUCTURAL CHANGES AND FARM RESPONSES ARE IMPLICIT IN THE ANALYSIS, FREEING THE ANALYST FROM
	THE BURDEN OF ESTIMATING THE E®ECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON PARTICULAR REGION-SPECI¯C CROPS AND
	FARMER RESPONSES."" ON THE OTHER HAND, ONE OF THE POTENTIAL DISADVANTAGES OF THE HEDONIC
	APPROACH IS THAT IT IS A PARTIAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS, I.E., AGRICULTURAL PRICES ARE ASSUMED TO
	REMAIN CONSTANT.1 WHILE YEAR-TO-YEAR °UCTUATIONS IN ANNUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS CERTAINLY
	HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT CURRENT COMMODITY PRICES, ESPECIALLY FOR CROPS PRODUCED ONLY
	IN A RELATIVELY LOCALIZED AREA, (SUCH AS CITRUS FRUITS WHICH ARE GROWN MAINLY IN CALIFORNIA
	AND FLORIDA), CHANGES IN LONG-RUN WEATHER PATTERNS (I.E., CHANGES IN CLIMATE) MIGHT HAVE A
	SMALLER E®ECT ON COMMODITY PRICES BECAUSE OF THE GREATER POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC ADAPTATION,
	PARTICULARLY SHIFTS IN GROWING REGIONS.2 THE HEDONIC APPROACH AS IMPLEMENTED BY MNS
	PREDICTS THAT EXISTING AGRICULTURAL LAND ON AVERAGE MIGHT BE MORE PRODUCTIVE AND HENCE RESULT
	IN BENE¯TS FOR U.S. FARMERS.3 THE HEDONIC APPROACH HAS RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN OUR
	JUDGMENT IN PART BECAUSE THE CONCLUSIONS ARE AT VARIANCE WITH THOSE OF SOME OTHER STUDIES THAT SUGGEST WARMING WILL LEAD TO DAMAGES AND IN PART BECAUSE OF THE NEW METHODOLOGY.
	ALTHOUGH THE APPROACH IS APPEALING, IT IS AT THE SAME TIME VULNERABLE TO PROBLEMS RELATED
	TO MISSPECI¯CATION. SEVERAL AUTHORS HAVE QUESTIONED THE PARTICULAR IMPLEMENTATION IN MNS (WILLIAM R. CLINE,
	1996; ROBERT K. KAUFMANN, 1998; DARWIN (1999B); AND JOHN QUIGGIN AND JOHN K. HOROWITZ,
	1999). SPECI¯CALLY, THEY SUGGEST THAT (I) THE HEDONIC APPROACH CANNOT BE USED TO ESTIMATE
	DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT COSTS; (II) THE RESULTS ARE NOT ROBUST ACROSS DI®ERENT WEIGHTING SCHEMES;
	AND (III) THE INADEQUATE TREATMENT OF IRRIGATION IN THE ANALYSIS MIGHT BIAS THE RESULTS. THE ¯RST
	CRITICISM ALLUDES TO THE FACT THAT SOME FARMERS MIGHT NOT ¯ND IT PRO¯TABLE TO SWITCH TO NEW
	CROPPING PATTERNS GIVEN THEIR EXISTING CROP-SPECI¯C ¯XED CAPITAL. HOWEVER, CLIMATE CHANGE
	WILL OCCUR ONLY GRADUALLY AND MOST COSTS CAN THUS BE SEEN AS VARIABLE. IN THIS PAPER WE FOCUS
	ON THE LATTER TWO POINTS, ESPECIALLY THE ROLE OF IRRIGATION. PREVIOUS COMMENTS HAVE RAISED
	THEORETICAL CONCERNS ABOUT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF MISSPECI¯CATION RELATED TO IRRIGATION. WE
	PROVIDE AN EMPIRICAL TEST. ONCE IRRIGATION IS ACCOUNTED FOR, WE SHOW THAT RESULTS ALSO BECOME
	ROBUST ACROSS WEIGHTING SCHEMES OR MODELS. ELSEWHERE WE EXTEND THE ANALYSIS IN VARIOUS
	DIRECTIONS: CONSTRUCTION AND USE OF CLIMATE VARIABLES TIED MORE CLOSELY TO AGRONOMIC ¯NDINGS;
	DEVELOPMENT OF MORE ACCURATE MEASURES OF BOTH CLIMATE AND SOIL CONDITIONS; ADJUSTMENT
	FOR SPATIAL CORRELATION OF THE ERROR TERMS IN A HEDONIC REGRESSION; AND USE OF RECENT CLIMATE
	SCENARIOS THAT GO BEYOND THE TRADITIONAL ASSUMPTION OF UNIFORM IMPACTS ACROSS REGIONS OF
	A DOUBLING OF GREENHOUSE GAS CONCENTRATIONS IN THE ATMOSPHERE (WOLFRAM SCHLENKER ET AL.,
	2004). WE NOTE HERE THAT NONE OF THE IMPLIED CHANGES IN THE ANALYSIS A®ECTS THE ARGUMENTS
	CONCERNING IRRIGATION DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER.DOWNLOAD

	WE BEGIN THE PAPER BY CRITICALLY REVIEWING THE UNITARY MODEL (VERMEULEN, 2002), WHICH (1) ASSUMES THAT A SINGLE PREFERENCE REPRESENTS ALL AGENTS IN THE GROUP, OR EQUIVALENTLY, THAT ALL AGENTS HAVE IDENTICAL PREFERENCES; (2) IMPOSES THE CHOICE OF A BENEVOLENT DICTATOR ON THE GROUP; (3) ASSUMES THE GROUP’S BUDGET TO BE A SINGLE POOLED VALUE; (4) DOES NOT ALLOW BARGAINING OR NEGOTIATION, (5) NOR PERMITS KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERIENCE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MEMBERS TO LEAD TO THE USE OF DIFFERENT DECISION-MAKING STRATEGIES. THE IMPACT OF POLICIES AFFECTING GROUP MEMBERS DIFFERENTIALLY, FOR EXAMPLE, CANNOT BE CORRECTLY ASSESSED IN THE UNITARY MODEL BECAUSE ITS USE WILL LEAD TO ERRONEOUS WELFARE INFERENCES (VERMEULEN, 2002). CLEARLY, THE NEED FOR ALTERNATIVE MODELS IS PRESSING.
	IN THE REMAINDER OF THIS PAPER WE WILL SYNTHESIZE THE LITERATURE ACROSS DISCIPLINES WITH A VIEW TOWARDS CHARACTERIZING THE SHORTCOMINGS OF CURRENT APPROACHES TO MODELING GROUP DECISIONS. SUBSEQUENTLY WE BROACH A NUMBER OF ISSUE AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE FUTURE RESEARCH MUST ADDRESS TO IMPROVE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF GROUP DECISIONS AND TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO MODEL AND PREDICT OUTCOMES FROM SUCH DECISIONS. WE THEN PRESENT A CONCEPTUAL MODEL OF GROUP DECISIONMAKING THAT AROSE FROM OUR DISCUSSIONS AND, WE FEEL, SYNTHESIZES THE MULTIDISCIPLINARY VIEWS REPRESENTED IN THE WORKSHOP. WE CONCLUDE BY PROPOSING A NUMBER OF SPECIFIC RESEARCH QUESTIONS 3 THAT WE BELIEVE SHOULD BE ADDRESSED IN THE SHORT TERM.DOWNLOAD

	ECONOMISTS SOMETIMES FIND THEMSELVES IN THE POSITION OF HAVING TO EXTEND THE
	NEOCLASSICAL MODEL OF CONSUMER DEMAND TO SETTINGS WHERE, IN ADDITION TO THE CONVENTIONAL BUDGET
	CONSTRAINT, THERE ARE ONE OR MORE ADDITIONAL LINEAR CONSTRAINTS THAT RESTRICT THE CONSUMER’S UTILITY
	MAXIMIZATION PROBLEM. EXAMPLES INCLUDE POINT RATIONING [TOBIN-HOUTHAKKER (1950-51), TOBIN
	(1952)]; MODELS OF TIME ALLOCATION WHERE THE TIME CONSTRAINT CANNOT BE COLLAPSED INTO THE BUDGET
	CONSTRAINT [DE SERPA (1971); DE DONNEA (1972); MCCONNELL (1975); LYON (1978) LARSON AND
	SHAIKH (2001)]; AND MULTI-PERIOD PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION PROBLEMS [DIAMOND AND YAARI (1972)].
	WITHOUT EXCEPTION, THE EXISTING LITERATURE HAS FOCUSED ON DIFFERENTIAL PROPERTIES OF THE RESULTING
	DEMAND FUNCTIONS-I.E. ISSUES SUCH AS THE EFFECT OF RATIONING ON DEMAND ELASTICITIES, THE LE
	CHATELIER--SAMUELSON THEOREM, THE GENERALIZATION OF THE HICK-SLUTSKY DECOMPOSITION, AND OTHER
	COMPARATIVE STATIC RESULTS [SEE KUSUMOTO (1976), CHICHILNISKY AND KALMAN (1978), HATTA (1980),
	WAN (1981) AND THE REFERENCES CITED ABOVE]. BY EMPLOYING SOME “TRICKS WITH UTILITY FUNCTIONS”
	IN THE SPIRIT OF GORMAN (1976), I AM ABLE TO OBTAIN A GLOBAL CHARACTERIZATION OF THESE DEMAND
	FUNCTIONS. SPECIFICALLY, I DEVELOP AN ALGORITHM FOR DERIVING THE DEMAND FUNCTIONS THAT APPLY
	WHEN THERE ARE M LINEAR CONSTRAINTS FROM THOSE THAT APPLY WHEN THESE IS ONLY A SINGLE CONSTRAINT.
	THE ALGORITHM PERMITS ONE TO DERIVE ALL OF THE EXISTING COMPARATIVE STATIC RESULTS IN A SIMPLE AND
	COMPACT MANNER. IT ALSO HAS SOME VALUE FOR EMPIRICAL DEMAND ANALYSIS, BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW TO COMPUTE THE DEMAND FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH MAXIMIZATION PROBLEMS INVOLVING MULTIPLE LINEAR CONSTRAINT BASED ON DIRECT OR INDIRECT UTILITY FUNCTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH KNOWN CONVENTIONAL DEMAND FUNCTIONS.
	THE PAPER IS ORGANIZED AS FOLLOWS. SECTION 2 PRESENTS SOME PRELIMINARY RESULTS WHICH ARE
	NEEDED FOR THE MAIN ANALYSIS, BUT ARE ALSO OF INTEREST AS ""TRICKS” IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. SECTION 3
	CONSIDERS THE UTILITY MAXIMIZATION PROBLEM WITH TWO LINEAR CONSTRAINTS, SUMMARIZES THE EXISTING
	COMPARATIVE STATIC RESULTS, DEVELOPS THE NEW GLOBAL REPRESENTATION THEOREM, AND SHOWS HOW
	THIS CAN BE USED TO DERIVE AND SHARPEN THE EXISTING COMPARATIVE STATIC RESULTS. SECTION 4 CONSIDERS
	A UTILITY MAXIMIZATION PROBLEM WITH THREE LINEAR CONSTRAINTS AND DEVELOPS THE ANALOGOUS GLOBAL
	REPRESENTATION THEOREM FOR THE SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM IN TERMS OF KNOWN DEMAND FUNCTIONS
	ASSOCIATED WITH A CONVENTIONAL SINGLE-CONSTRAINT PROBLEM; THE RESULTS DEVELOPED HERE PROVIDE THE
	BASIS FOR EXTENSION TO PROBLEMS INVOLVING MORE THAN THREE LINEAR CONSTRAINTS. SECTION 5 OFFERS

					WORKING PAPER (FEBRUARY 2002)
	IN MANY AREAS OF THE WORLD, INCLUDING LARGE PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES, SCARCE
	WATER SUPPLIES ARE A SERIOUS RESOURCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERN. THE POSSIBILITY
	EXISTS THAT WATER IS BEING USED AT RATES THAT EXCEED WHAT WOULD BE DICTATED BY
	EFFICIENCY CRITERIA, PARTICULARLY WHEN EXTERNALITIES ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. BECAUSE
	OF THIS, MUCH ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID BY POLICY MAKERS AND OTHERS TO THE USE OF
	DEMAND MANAGEMENT TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS FOR THE ADOPTION OF SPECIFIC
	TECHNOLOGIES AND RESTRICTIONS ON PARTICULAR USES. A NATURAL QUESTION FOR ECONOMISTS
	TO ASK IS WHETHER PRICE WOULD BE A MORE COST-EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT TO FACILITATE WATER
	DEMAND MANAGEMENT.
	AS A FIRST STEP IN SUCH AN INVESTIGATION, THIS PAPER DRAWS UPON A NEWLY-AVAILABLE
	SET OF DETAILED DATA TO ESTIMATE ECONOMETRICALLY THE DEMAND FUNCTION FOR HOUSEHOLD
	USE OF URBAN WATER SUPPLIES. WE ANALYZE CROSS-SECTIONAL TIME-SERIES DATA THAT TRACK
	1,082 SINGLE-FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS SERVED BY 16 WATER UTILITIES IN 11 URBAN AREAS IN THE
	UNITED STATES AND CANADA. BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSE MULTIPLE-BLOCK PRICING STRUCTURES
	THAT ABOUND, ESTIMATING THE EFFECTS OF PRICE AND PRICE STRUCTURE ON RESIDENTIAL WATER
	DEMAND POSES SOME CHALLENGING AND INTERESTING PROBLEMS.
	WE FIND THAT THE SENSITIVITY OF RESIDENTIAL WATER DEMAND TO PRICE IS QUITE LOW,
	AND THAT THE EFFECT OF PRICE STRUCTURE MAY BE MORE INFLUENTIAL THAN THE MAGNITUDE

	THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES THE EBRO INTER-BASIN TRANSFER, WHICH WAS THE MAIN PROJECT OF THE SPANISH
	NATIONAL HYDROLOGICAL PLAN. THE EBRO TRANSFER WAS PROMPTED BY PERVASIVE PRESSURES, SCARCITY AND
	DEGRADATION OF SOUTHEASTERN BASINS IN SPAIN. THE HEATED POLICY DEBATE ON THE EBRO TRANSFER, HIGHLIGHTS THE
	DIFFICULTIES OF ACHIEVING A SUSTAINABLE WATER MANAGEMENT, BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICTING INTERESTS OF STAKEHOLDERS
	AND REGIONS. ALTERNATIVES TO THE EBRO TRANSFER SHOW THAT, ACCEPTABLE OUTCOMES COMBINE DEMAND AND SUPPLY
	MEASURES. NEVERTHELESS, IMPLEMENTATION COULD BE DIFFICULT AND REQUIRES COMPENSATION TO FARMERS, OTHERWISE
	AN EXCESSIVE BURDEN ON FARMERS WOULD BE MET BY SOCIAL OPPOSITION LEADING TO THE FAILURE OF MEASURES.DOWNLOAD

	THIS CHAPTER EXPLAINS THE ECONOMIC CONCEPTION OF WATER -HOW ECONOMISTS THINK ABOUT
	WATER. IT CONSISTS OF TWO MAIN SECTIONS. FIRST, IT REVIEWS THE ECONOMIC CONCEPT OF VALUE, EXPLAINS HOW IT IS
	MEASURED, AND DISCUSSES HOW THIS HAS BEEN APPLIED TO WATER IN VARIOUS WAYS. THEN IT CONSIDERS THE DEBATE
	REGARDING WHETHER OR NOT WATER CAN, OR SHOULD, BE TREATETL AS AN ECONOMIC COMMODITY, AND DISCUSSES THE
	WAYS IN WHICH WATER IS THE SAME AS, OR DIFFERENT THAN, OTHER COMMODITIES FROM AN ECONOMIC POINT OF VIEW.
	WHILE THERE ARE SOME DISTINCTIVE EMOTIVE AND SYMBOLIC FEATURES OF WATER, THERE ARE ALSO SOME DISTINCTIVE
	ECONOMIC FEATURES THAT MAKE THE DEMAND AND SUPPLY OF WATER DIFFERENT AND MORE COMPLEX THAN THAT OF

	ALTHOUGH THE DOUBLE-BOUND (DB) FONNAT FOR THE DISCRETE CHOICE
	CONTINGENT VALUATION METHOD (CVM) HAS THE BENEFIT OF HIGHER EFFICIENCY IN
	WELFARE BENEFIT ESTIMATES THAN THE SINGLE-BOUND (SB) DISCRETE CHOICE
	CVM, IT HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO CRITICISM DUE TO EVIDENCE THAT SOME OF THE
	RESPONSES TO THE SECOND BID MAY BE INCONSISTENT WITH THE RESPONSES TO THE
	FIRST BID. AS A MEANS TO REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR RESPONSE BIAS ON THE
	FOLLOW-UP BID IN MULTIPLE-BOUND DISCRETE CHOICE FORMATS SUCH AS THE DB
	MODEL WHILE MAINTAINING MUCH OF THE EFFICIENCY GAINS OF THE MULTIPLEBOUND APPROACH, WE INTRODUCE THE ONE-AND-ONE-HALF-BOUND (OOHB) APPROACH AND PRESENT A REAL-WORLD APPLICATION. IN A LABORATORY SETTING,
	DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE OOHB MODEL USES LESS INFORMATION THAN THE DB
	APPROACH, THE EFFICIENCY GAINS IN MOVING FROM SB TO OOHB CAPTURE A
	LARGE PORTION OF THE GAIN ASSOCIATED WITH MOVING FROM SB TO DB. UTILIZING
	DISTRIBUTION-FREE SEMINONPARAMETRIC ESTIMATION TECHNIQUES ON A SPLITSURVEY DATA SET, OUR OOHB ESTIMATES DEMONSTRATED HIGHER CONSISTENCY
	WITH RESPECT TO THE FOLLOW-UP DATA THAN THE DB ESTIMATES AND WERE MORE
	EFFICIENT AS WELL. HENCE, OOHB MAY SERVE AS A VIABLE ALTERNATIVE TO THE

	ACCORDING TO MANY SEASONED SURVEY RESEARCHERS, OFFERING A NO-OPINION OPTION SHOULD REDUCE THE PRESSURE TO GIVE SUBSTANTIVE RESPONSES FELT BY RESPONDENTS WHO HAVE NO TRUE OPINIONS. BY CONTRAST, THE SURVEY SATISFICING PERSPECTIVE SUGGESTS THAT NO-OPINION OPTIONS MAY DISCOURAGE SOME RESPONDENTS FROM DOING THE COGNITIVE WORK NECESSARY TO REPORT THE TRUE OPINIONS THEY DO HAVE. WE ADDRESS THESE ARGUMENTS USING
	DATA FROM NINE EXPERIMENTS CARRIED OUT IN THREE HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS. ATTRACTION TO NO-OPINION OPTIONS WAS FOUND TO BE GREATEST AMONG RESPONDENTS LOWEST IN COGNITIVE SKILLS (AS MEASURED BY EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT), AMONG RESPONDENTS ANSWERING SECRETLY INSTEAD OF ORALLY, FOR QUESTIONS ASKED LATER IN A SURVEY, AND AMONG RESPONDENTS WHO DEVOTED LITTLE EFFORT TO THE REPORTING PROCESS. THE QUALITY OF ATTITUDE REPORTS OBTAINED (AS MEASURED BY OVER-TIME CONSISTENCY AND RESPONSIVENESS TO A QUESTION MANIPULATION) WAS NOT COMPROMISED BY THE OMISSION OF NOOPINION OPTIONS. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT INCLUSION OF NO-OPINION OPTIONS IN ATTITUDE MEASURES MAY NOT ENHANCE DATA QUALITY AND INSTEAD MAY
	PRECLUDE MEASUREMENT OF SOME MEANINGFUL OPINIONS.DOWNLOAD

WORKING PAPER (JUNE 2019)THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE RISE OF LEGISLATIVE RESTRICTIONS ON FOREIGN FUNDING TO NGOS, A GLOBAL TREND OCCURRING NOT ONLY IN AID-DEPENDENT, NON-DEMOCRATIC REGIMES BUT ALSO MORE RECENTLY IN DEVELOPED ECONOMIES AND DEMOCRACIES. I CREATE A DATASET OF 65 COUNTRIES WITH LEGISLATIVE RESTRICTIONS AND DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING ECONOMIES, AS WELL AS CONSOLIDATED AND TRANSITIONING DEMOCRACIES. I USE PANEL DATA, POLYNOMIAL INTERPOLATION, AND LOGISTIC REGRESSION TO EXAMINE PREDICTORS OF FOREIGN FUNDING RESTRICTIONS, IN PARTICULAR, FOREIGN AID, NATURAL RESOURCE EXTRACTION, CONFLICT RISK, AND REGIME TYPE. BY COLLAPSING THE WIDE VARIETY OF CASES INTO REGIME TYPE, AND WITHIN REGIME TYPE, DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN RESOURCE-RICH COUNTRIES AS WELL AS COUNTRIES PRONE TO GLOBAL RISK IN TERMS OF NATIONAL AND SUBNATIONAL POWER, MY FRAMEWORK ACCOUNTS FOR THE RISE OF LEGISLATIVE RESTRICTIONS ACROSS DIVERSE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXTS, AND PAYS CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE PARADOX OF THE RISE OF FOREIGN FUNDING RESTRICTIONS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY DEMOCRACIES. OVERALL, THE PRESENCE OF THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT ACROSS REGIME TYPES AND EVEN IN DEMOCRACIES IN PARTICULAR AS THE MAJORITY OF COUNTRIES WITH RESTRICTIONS ARE RESOURCE-RICH.DOWNLOAD

RAAJ SAH|WEBSITE: RAAJSAH.COM RAAJ SAH IS PROFESSOR OF PUBLIC POLICY AND ECONOMICS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, HARRIS SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY. HE HAS PREVIOUSLY HELD FACULTY POSITIONS IN BUSINESS, ECONOMICS, AND PUBLIC POLICY AT THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY, PRINCETON UNIVERSITY, UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA, AND YALE UNIVERSITY. HE HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL HONORS FOR HIS TEACHING, INCLUDING THREE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO. PROFESSOR SAH HAS RECEIVED THE ORDER OF THE RISING SUN, GOLD RAYS WITH NECK RIBBON. THE GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN CONFERRED THIS HONOR ON BEHALF OF HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR OF JAPAN. PROFESSOR SAH HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT’S ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, INCLUDING THOSE ON TAX REFORMS, PUBLIC REVENUES, DEFICITS, AND REDISTRIBUTION. THESE ARE SOME OF THE CENTRAL ISSUES FOR JAPAN.  PROFESSOR SAH HOLDS A PHD IN ECONOMICS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA. HE IS AN MBA FROM THE INDIAN INSTITUTE OF MANAGEMENT AHMEDABAD. HIS EARLIER EDUCATION IS FROM BIRLA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY AND SCIENCE PILANI, AND FROM ST. XAVIER’S COLLEGE RANCHI. BORN IN INDIA, HE IS A US CITIZEN. MANY OF THE WRITINGS OF PROFESSOR SAH CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM RAAJSAH.COM. OTHER WRITINGS ARE AVAILABLE AT ECONPAPERS, IDEAS, SSRN, AND ELSEWHERE ON THE WEB.   THREE OF HIS CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECONOMICS ARE BRIEFLY SUMMARIZED BELOW: 1. A HARDWIRED HUMAN CHARACTERISTIC IS FALLIBILITY. THIS FALLIBILITY RESIDES DEEPER THAN WHAT CAN BE REMOVED BY VASTLY LARGER MODELS, BIG AND BIGGER DATA, IMMENSELY GREATER COMPUTATIONAL POWER, ARTIFICIAL AND OTHER LOGIC, ETC. PROFESSOR SAH HAS SHOWN HOW, WITHIN VARIOUS KINDS OF ORGANIZATIONS, INDIVIDUALS’ FALLIBILITIES COMBINE TOGETHER TO PRODUCE DIFFERENT OVERALL CONSEQUENCES OF FALLIBILITY. THIS WORK HAS BEEN APPLIED IN MANY CONTEXTS. AMONG THEM ARE FINANCE, SEVERAL BRANCHES OF MANAGEMENT SCIENCES, COMPARISONS OF ALTERNATIVE SOCIETAL SYSTEMS (E.G., POLYARCHIES VERSUS HIERARCHIES), THE ARCHITECTURES OF ORGANIZATIONS AND, AS DESCRIBED BELOW, THE ISSUE OF DECENTRALIZATION VERSUS CENTRALIZATION. THE DECENTRALIZATION VERSUS CENTRALIZATION OF AUTHORITY AND LEADERSHIP IS AN EVER-PRESENT AND A FOUNDATIONAL ISSUE IN SOCIAL SCIENCES. IT ARISES IN ALL FORMS AND AT  ALL SCALES OF ORGANIZATIONS; FOR EXAMPLE, FROM FAMILIES TO MEGA CORPORATIONS. THIS ISSUE IS ALSO CENTRAL TO POLITICS; ITS VARIATIONS ARE AT LEAST AS OLD AS PLATO, AND AS CONTEMPORARY AS THE UNIFICATION VERSUS AUTONOMY WITHIN THE EUROPEAN UNION. PROFESSOR SAH WAS THE FIRST TO MAKE SPECIFIC AND TESTABLE PREDICTIONS ON THIS TOPIC. ONE SUCH PREDICTION (THE SAH CONJECTURE) IS: A GREATER DECENTRALIZATION OF AUTHORITY REDUCES THE VOLATILITY OF OUTCOMES. OTHER SCHOLARS HAVE CONFIRMED THIS PREDICTION THROUGH THEIR EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATIONS. 2. COMPARABLE SOCIETIES AND GEOGRAPHICAL REGIONS CAN DISPLAY MARKEDLY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF CRIME AND CORRUPTION. ANALOGOUSLY, COMPARABLE BUSINESS ORGANIZATIONS OFTEN HAVE QUITE DIFFERENT INTERNAL WORK ETHE AND ECOLOGIES. SUCH DIFFERENCES ARE TYPICALLY ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENCES IN CULTURES. THIS IS OFTEN A RESPECTABLE-SOUNDING WAY OF SAYING THAT ONE DOES NOT UNDERSTAND SUCH PHENOMENA. PROFESSOR SAH HAS SHOWN HOW PERCEPTIONS AND REALITIES INFLUENCE EACH OTHER DYNAMICALLY ACROSS TIME. PEOPLES’ CURRENT PERCEPTIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE PRESENT AND PAST REALITIES. THESE PERCEPTIONS AFFECT THE INDIVIDUALS’ CURRENT CHOICES AND ACTIONS. SUCH CHOICES, IN TURN, SHAPE FUTURE REALITIES, WHICH THEN INFLUENCE FUTURE PERCEPTIONS. THIS CONCEPTUAL AND ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK HAS EXPLAINED MANY DIFFICULT-TO-UNDERSTAND PHENOMENA AND PATTERNS. 3. PROFESSOR SAH HAS MADE MANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO PUBLIC FINANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, AN IDEA THAT HAS BEEN POPULAR FOR CENTURIES IS THAT INEQUALITIES OF WELL-BEING ACROSS PEOPLE CAN BE REDUCED BY SUBSIDIZING THE NECESSITIES OF LIFE, AND BY PAYING FOR THESE SUBSIDIES BY TAXING THE LUXURIES. VARIATIONS OF THIS IDEA CONTINUE TO HAVE STRONG APPEAL, ESPECIALLY IN THOSE COUNTRIES WHERE TAXES ON GOODS AND SERVICES ARE A PRIMARY FOUNDATION OF THE GOVERNMENTS’ FINANCES. PROFESSOR SAH WAS THE FIRST TO ASK THE QUESTION: HOW MUCH REDISTRIBUTION IS ACTUALLY POSSIBLE THROUGH SUCH POLICIES? THIS IS BECAUSE WITHOUT DETERMINING WHAT IS FEASIBLE, ANY OTHER ANALYSIS WILL NOT BE MEANINGFUL. THE FOLLOWING IS A QUOTATION (FROM TRESCH)  ON ONE OF HIS MANY ORIGINAL RESULTS ON THE TOPIC OUTLINED IN THE PREVIOUS PARAGRAPH: “RAAJ SAH DEVELOPED A SIMPLE AND INGENIOUS METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE LIMITS OF REDISTRIBUTION UNDER COMMODITY TAXATION THAT RELIES ONLY ON THE GOVERNMENT’S BUDGET CONSTRAINT. HIS METHOD LED HIM TO CONCLUDE THAT COMMODITY TAXES AND SUBSIDIES ARE UNLIKELY TO HAVE MUCH EQUALIZING EFFECT ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME.”   (PROFESSOR SAH IS PLEASED TO CONVERSE WITH CURRENT AND FORMER STUDENTS, COLLEAGUES, AND OTHERS.

OBJECTIVE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER WAS TO EXAMINE THE PATTERNS OF SPENDING, PRICE, AND THE UTILIZATION OF ADHD MEDICATIONS DURING THE 10-YEAR PERIOD, FROM1994 TO 2003 AMONG 4 DIFFERENT PER CAPITA GDP GROUP COUNTRIES.
METHODS THIS STUDY USED THE IMS HEALTH DATABASE AND INCLUDED BOTH BRANDED AND GENERIC ADHD MEDICATIONS. WE EXAMINED THE CHANGES IN QUANTITY AND PRICE AS WELL AS THE MIXED EFFECTS OF THESE CHANGES IN THE U.S.A. AND 3 OTHER GROUPS OF COUNTRIES CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR LEVEL OF PER CAPITA GDP.
RESULTS DURING THIS STUDY (1994–2003), THE U.S. EXPENDITURES FOR ADHD MEDICATIONS INCREASED 594%; SALES VOLUME ROSE BY 80%; AND PRICE INCREASED BY 285%. IN OTHER HIGH GDP COUNTRIES, EXPENDITURES INCREASED 493%, SALES VOLUME 328%, AND PRICE INCREASED BY 39%. IN THE MIDDLE GDP COUNTRIES, EXPENDITURES INCREASED 164%, SALES VOLUME 141%, AND PRICE INCREASED BY 9%. IN THE COUNTRIES WITH A LOWER PER CAPITA GDP, EXPENDITURES INCREASED 149%, SALES VOLUME 464%, HOWEVER PRICE DECREASED BY 37%.
CONCLUSIONS THE LAUNCH OF LONG-ACTING ADHD MEDICATIONS HAS DRAMATICALLY INCREASED THE TOTAL MEDICATION EXPENDITURE IN THE U.S. AS WELL AS IN OTHER HIGH GDP MARKETS. IN THE OTHER COUNTRIES QUANTITY WAS THE MOST IMPORTANT GROWTH FACTOR.

	THIS PAPER USES A FORECASTING MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE NEED FOR, SUPPLY OF, AND SHORTAGE OF DOCTORS, NURSES, AND MIDWIVES IN THIRTY-NINE AFRICAN COUNTRIES FOR 2015, THE TARGET DATE OF THE UNITED NATIONS MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS. WE FORECAST THAT THIRTY-ONE COUNTRIES WILL EXPERIENCE NEEDS-BASED SHORTAGES OF DOCTORS, NURSES, AND MIDWIVES, TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 800,000 HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. WE ESTIMATE THE ADDITIONAL ANNUAL WAGE BILL REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE THE SHORTAGE AT ABOUT $2.6 BILLION (2007 $US)—MORE THAN 2.5 TIMES CURRENT WAGE-BILL PROJECTIONS FOR 2015. WE ILLUSTRATE HOW CHANGES IN WORKFORCE MIX CAN REDUCE THIS COST, AND WE DISCUSS POLICY IMPLICATIONS OF OUR RESULTS.DOWNLOAD

	WE PERFORMED A PILOT STUDY EXAMINING THE PATTERNS OF RECOVERY FROM SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS IN A MODEL INTEGRATED SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM USING MEASURES FROM THE MILESTONES OF RECOVERY SCALE (MORS), A VALID AND RELIABLE MEASURE OF RECOVERY OUTCOMES WHICH RANGES FROM 1 TO 8 (8 LEVELS). FOR PURPOSES OF PRESENTATION, WE CONSTRUCTED AN AGGREGATE MORS (6 LEVELS) WHERE THE LEVELS ARE DESCRIBED AS FOLLOWS: (1) EXTREME RISK; (2) UNENGAGED, POORLY SELFCOORDINATING; (3) ENGAGED, POORLY SELF-COORDINATING; (4) COPING AND REHABILITATING; (5) EARLY RECOVERY, AND (6) SELF RELIANT. WE ANALYZED MORS DATA ON INDIVIDUALS FOLLOWED OVER TIME FROM THE VILLAGE IN LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA (658 OBSERVATIONS). USING MARKOV CHAINS, WE ESTIMATED ORIGINDESTINATION TRANSITION PROBABILITIES, SIMULATING RECOVERY OUTCOMES FOR 100 MONTHS. OUR MODELS SUGGEST THAT AFTER 12 MONTHS ONLY 8% OF ‘‘EXTREME RISK’’ CLIENTS REMAIN SUCH. OVER 40% HAVE MOVED TO ‘‘ENGAGED, POORLY SELF-COORDINATING.’’ AFTER 2 YEARS, ALMOST HALF OF THE INITIAL ‘‘EXTREME RISK’’ CLIENTS ARE ‘‘COPING/REHABILITATING’’, ‘‘EARLY RECOVERY’’ OR ‘‘SELF RELIANT.’’ MOST GAINS OCCUR WITHIN 2 YEARS.DOWNLOAD

OBJECTIVE. APPROXIMATELY 4.4 MILLION (7.8%) CHILDREN IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN DIAGNOSED WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER, AND 56% OF AFFECTED CHILDREN TAKE PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS TO TREAT THE DISORDER. ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER IS STRONGLY LINKED WITH LOW ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT, BUT THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MEDICATION USE AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT IN SCHOOL SETTINGS IS LARGELY UNKNOWN. OUR OBJECTIVE WAS TO DETERMINE IF REPORTED MEDICATION USE FOR ATTENTIONDEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER IS POSITIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT DURING ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.
METHOD. TO ESTIMATE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN REPORTED MEDICATION USE AND STANDARDIZED MATHEMATICS AND READING ACHIEVEMENT SCORES FOR A US SAMPLE OF 594 CHILDREN WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER, WE USED 5 SURVEY WAVES BETWEEN KINDERGARTEN AND FIFTH GRADE FROM THE NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE EARLY CHILDHOOD LONGITUDINAL STUDY—KINDERGARTEN CLASS OF 1998 –1999 TO ESTIMATE A FIRST-DIFFERENCED REGRESSION MODEL, WHICH CONTROLLED FOR TIME-INVARIANT CONFOUNDING VARIABLES.
RESULTS. MEDICATED CHILDREN HAD A MEAN MATHEMATICS SCORE THAT WAS 2.9 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE MEAN SCORE OF UNMEDICATED PEERS WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER. CHILDREN WHO WERE MEDICATED FOR A LONGER DURATION (AT 2 WAVES) HAD A MEAN READING SCORE THAT WAS 5.4 POINTS HIGHER THAN THE MEAN SCORE OF UNMEDICATED PEERS WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER. THE MEDICATION-READING ASSOCIATION WAS LOWER FOR CHILDREN WHO HAD AN INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PROGRAM THAN FOR THOSE WITHOUT SUCH EDUCATIONAL ACCOMMODATION.
CONCLUSIONS. THE FINDING OF A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MEDICATION USE AND STANDARDIZED MATHEMATICS AND READING TEST SCORES IS IMPORTANT, GIVEN THE HIGH PREVALENCE OF ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER AND ITS ASSOCIATION WITH LOW ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT. THE 2.9-POINT MATHEMATICS AND 5.4-POINT READING SCORE DIFFERENCES ARE COMPARABLE WITH SCORE GAINS OF 0.19 AND 0.29 SCHOOL YEARS, RESPECTIVELY, BUT THESE GAINS ARE INSUFFICIENT TO ELIMINATE THE TEST-SCORE GAP BETWEEN CHILDREN WITH ATTENTION-DEFICIT/HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER AND THOSE WITHOUT THE DISORDER. LONG-TERM TRIALS ARE NEEDED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MEDICATION USE AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.DOWNLOAD

OBJECTIVE. TO DETERMINE WHETHER VARIATION IN THE REPRESENTATION OF MINORITY PHYSICIANS ACROSS GEOGRAPHICAL AREAS IN CALIFORNIA AFFECTS THE LOCATION DECISIONS OF MINORITY PHYSICIANS.
DATA SOURCES. WE ANALYZED DATA ON 9,806 RESIDENTS AND 53,606 PATIENT-CARE PHYSICIANS FROM THE 1997–2003 AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION MASTERFILES FOR CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH DATA FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE, RAND, AND OTHER SOURCES.
STUDY DESIGN. WE ESTIMATED DEPARTURE MODELS USING LINEAR PROBABILITY MODELS AND DESTINATION MODELS USING CONDITIONAL LOGIT. EACH MODEL CONTROLLED FOR PHYSICIAN AND COUNTY CHARACTERISTICS. PARAMETERS OF INTEREST INCLUDE THE INTERACTIONS OF PHYSICIAN RACE/ ETHNICITY WITH AREA-LEVEL MINORITY PHYSICIAN REPRESENTATION FOR THE CORRESPONDING RACE/ ETHNICITY.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS. DEPARTURE MODELS SHOW THAT BLACK AND HISPANIC PHYSICIANS ARE MORE LIKELY TO REMAIN IN AN AREA AS THE LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION OF PHYSICIANS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE GROUPS WORSENS. THE DESTINATION MODELS SHOW THAT BLACK, ASIAN, AND HISPANIC PHYSICIANS TEND TO MOVE TO AREAS WHERE THE LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION IS SIMILAR TO THAT OF THEIR PREVIOUS LOCATION.
CONCLUSIONS. BLACK AND HISPANIC PHYSICIANS ARE INFLUENCED BY THE LEVEL OF REPRESENTATION OF PHYSICIANS FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE GROUPS IN THEIR LOCATION DECISIONS AND TEND TO LOCATE WHERE NEEDED.DOWNLOAD

	IN INTRODUCING THIS SPECIAL ISSUE ON SOCIAL CAPITAL AND HEALTH, THIS ARTICLE TRACKS THE POPULARIZATION OF THE TERM AND SHEDS LIGHT ON THE CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING THE TERM AND ITS DEFINITIONS. IT SETS OUT FOUR MECHANISMS THAT LINK SOCIAL CAPITAL WITH HEALTH: MAKING INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS, IMPACTING SOCIAL NORMS, ENHANCING THE HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND THEIR ACCESSIBILITY IN A COMMUNITY, AND OFFERING PSYCHOSOCIAL SUPPORT NETWORKS. APPROACHES TO THE MEASUREMENT OF SOCIAL CAPITAL INCLUDE THE SOCIAL CAPITAL COMMUNITY BENCHMARK SURVEY (SCCBS) DEVELOPED BY ROBERT PUTNAM, AND THE PETRIS SOCIAL CAPITAL INDEX (PSCI), WHICH LOOKS AT COMMUNITY VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS USING PUBLIC DATA AVAILABLE FOR THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES. THE ARTICLE DEFINES COMMUNITY SOCIAL CAPITAL (CSC) AS THE EXTENT AND DENSITY OF TRUST, COOPERATION, AND ASSOCIATIONAL LINKS AND ACTIVITY WITHIN A GIVEN POPULATION. FOUR ARTICLES ON CSC ARE INTRODUCED IN TWO CATEGORIES: THOSE THAT ADDRESS BEHAVIORS -- PARTICULARLY UTILIZATION OF HEALTH SERVICES AND USE OF TOBACCO, ALCOHOL, AND DRUGS; AND THOSE THAT LOOK AT LINKS BETWEEN SOCIAL CAPITAL AND PHYSICAL OR MENTAL HEALTH. POLICY IMPLICATIONS INCLUDE: FUNDING AND/OR TAX SUBSIDIES THAT WOULD SUPPORT THE CREATION OF SOCIAL CAPITAL; LAWS AND REGULATIONS; AND GENERATION OF ENTHUSIASM AMONG COMMUNITIES AND LEADERS TO DEVELOP SOCIAL CAPITAL. THE NEXT STEPS IN THE RESEARCH PROGRAMME ARE TO CONTINUE TESTING THE MECHANISMS; TO LOOK FOR NATURAL EXPERIMENTS; AND TO FIND BETTER PUBLIC POLICIES TO FOSTER SOCIAL CAPITAL.

	THE WORLD HEALTH REPORT 2006: WORKING TOGETHER FOR HEALTH HAS BROUGHT RENEWED ATTENTION TO THE GLOBAL HUMAN RESOURCES REQUIRED TO PRODUCE HEALTH.1 IT ESTIMATED THAT 57 COUNTRIES HAVE AN ABSOLUTE SHORTAGE OF 2.3 MILLION PHYSICIANS, NURSES AND MIDWIVES. THESE SHORTAGES SUGGEST THAT MANY COUNTRIES HAVE INSUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF HEALTH PROFESSIONALS TO DELIVER ESSENTIAL HEALTH INTERVENTIONS, SUCH AS SKILLED ATTENDANCE AT BIRTH AND IMMUNIZATION PROGRAMMES. HOWEVER, THESE ESTIMATES DO NOT TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE ABILITY OF COUNTRIES TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN THESE WORKERS, NOR ARE THEY SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO INFORM POLICY-MAKERS ABOUT HOW, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, HEALTH WORKFORCE INVESTMENT SHOULD BE CHANNELLED INTO TRAINING OF DIFFERENT PROFESSIONS.
	THIS PAPER FOCUSES ON PHYSICIANS, WHO SERVE A KEY ROLE IN HEALTH-CARE PROVISION. USING THE MOST UPDATED INFORMATION ON THE SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS OVER A 20-YEAR PERIOD, WE PROJECT THE SIZE OF THE FUTURE GLOBAL NEED FOR, DEMAND FOR AND SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS TO YEAR 2015, THE TARGET DATE FOR THE MILLENNIUM DEVELOPMENT GOALS (MDGS).2 NEEDS-BASED ESTIMATES USE AN EXOGENOUS HEALTH BENCHMARK TO JUDGE THE ADEQUACY OF THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS REQUIRED TO MEET MDG TARGETS. DEMAND ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON A COUNTRY’S ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE INCREASE IN HEALTH-CARE SPENDING THAT RESULTS FROM IT, WHICH PRIMARILY GOES TOWARDS WORKER SALARIES. WE THEN COMPARE THE NEEDS-BASED AND DEMAND-BASED ESTIMATES TO THE PROJECTED SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS, EXTRAPOLATED BASED ON HISTORICAL TRENDS. OUR RESULTS POINT TO DRAMATIC SHORTAGES OF PHYSICIANS IN THE WHO AFRICAN REGION BY 2015. WE PROVIDE ESTIMATES OF SHORTAGES BY COUNTRY IN AFRICA AND DISCUSS THEIR IMPLICATIONS FOR DIFFERENT WORKFORCE POLICY CHOICES.

	SOCIAL CAPITAL HAS BEEN SHOWN TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCED MORTALITY DUE TO CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. OUR AIM WAS TO DETERMINE THE ASSOCIATION OF TIME-VARYING COMMUNITY-LEVEL SOCIAL CAPITAL (CSC) WITH RECURRENCE OF ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME USING A RETROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY DESIGN. A TOTAL OF 34,752 MEN AND WOMEN WERE IDENTIFIED, AGED 30–85 YEARS, WHO WERE HOSPITALIZED FOR ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 1998 AND DECEMBER 31, 2002 IN KAISER PERMANENTE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA, USA, AN INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE PRIMARY OUTCOME WAS RECURRENT NON-FATAL OR FATAL ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME; MEDIAN FOLLOW-UP WAS 19 MONTHS. WE ESTIMATED RANDOM-EFFECTS, THREE-LEVEL COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARD MODELS ADJUSTING FOR SEX, AGE, RACE/ETHNICITY, COMORBIDITIES, MEDICATION USE, AND REVASCULARIZATION PROCEDURES AT LEVEL 1, MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME FOR THE CENSUS BLOCK-GROUP AT LEVEL 2, AND INCOME INEQUALITY, RACIAL/ETHNIC CONCENTRATION, PENETRATION OF HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATIONS, AND CSC AT LEVEL 3. OUR MEASURE OF CSC WAS THE PREVIOUSLY VALIDATED PETRIS SOCIAL CAPITAL INDEX (PSCI). WE FOUND THAT A ONE-STANDARD DEVIATION INCREASE IN THE PSCI, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE ABOVE COVARIATES, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH DECREASED RECURRENCE OF ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME ONLY FOR THOSE LIVING IN AREAS WHERE BLOCK-GROUP LEVEL MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME WAS BELOW THE GRAND MEDIAN COMPARED TO THOSE LIVING IN AREAS WHERE BLOCK-GROUP LEVEL MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME WAS AT THE GRAND MEDIAN OR ABOVE. THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT COMMUNITY-LEVEL SOCIAL CAPITAL MAY BE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH RECURRENCE OF ACUTE CORONARY SYNDROME AMONG LOWER-INCOME INDIVIDUALS.

	THIS PAPER EXAMINES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AREA-LEVEL SOCIAL CAPITAL AND NON-SPECIFIC PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS. IT DEMONSTRATES THAT NOT CONTROLLING FOR NON-TIME-VARYING OMITTED VARIABLES CAN SERIOUSLY BIAS RESEARCH FINDINGS. WE USE DATA FROM THREE CROSS-SECTIONS OF THE US NATIONAL HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY (1999, 2000, AND 2001): 37,172 OBSERVATIONS NESTED WITHIN 58 METROPOLITAN STATISTICAL AREAS. WE ALSO ADD DATA FROM THE AREA RESOURCE FILE AND COUNTY BUSINESS PATTERNS. WE USE A VALIDATED MEASURE OF SOCIAL CAPITAL, THE PETRIS SOCIAL CAPITAL INDEX (PSCI), WHICH MEASURES STRUCTURAL SOCIAL CAPITAL.
	WE ESTIMATE A TWO-LEVEL MULTILEVEL LINEAR MODEL WITH A RANDOM INTERCEPT. NON-SPECIFIC PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS IS MEASURED USING A VALID AND RELIABLE INDICATOR, THE K6. INDIVIDUAL-LEVEL VARIABLES INCLUDE SEX, AGE, RACE/ETHNICITY, MARITAL STATUS, EDUCATION, FAMILY INCOME, SMOKING STATUS, EXERCISE STATUS, AND NUMBER OF VISITS TO A HEALTH PROFESSIONAL. AREA-LEVEL COVARIATES INCLUDE THE PSCI, THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE, PSYCHIATRISTS PER 1000 POPULATION, NON-PSYCHIATRIC PHYSICIANS PER 1000 POPULATION, AND AREA-LEVEL INDICATORS TO ACCOUNT FOR NON-TIME-VARYING AREA-LEVEL OMITTED VARIABLE BIAS. TIME DUMMIES ARE ALSO INCLUDED.
	WE FIND THAT LAGGED AREA-LEVEL SOCIAL CAPITAL IS NEGATIVELY RELATED TO NON-SPECIFIC PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS AMONG INDIVIDUALS WHOSE FAMILY INCOME IS LESS THAN THE MEDIAN. THESE ASSOCIATIONS ARE MUCH LARGER WHEN WE CONTROL FOR NON-TIME-VARYING AREA-LEVEL OMITTED VARIABLES.

	LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE GLOBAL USE AND COST OF MEDICATIONS FOR ATTENTION DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER (ADHD). GLOBAL USE OF ADHD MEDICATIONS ROSE THREEFOLD FROM 1993 THROUGH 2003, WHEREAS GLOBAL SPENDING (2.4 BILLION US DOLLARS IN 2003) ROSE NINEFOLD, ADJUSTING FOR INFLATION. PER CAPITA GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (GDP) ROBUSTLY PREDICTED USE ACROSS COUNTRIES, BUT THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA SHOWED SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER-THAN-PREDICTED USE. USE AND SPENDING GREW IN BOTH DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, BUT SPENDING GROWTH WAS CONCENTRATED IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES, WHICH ADOPTED MORE COSTLY, LONG-ACTING FORMULATIONS. PROMOTING OPTIMAL PRESCRIPTION AND MONITORING SHOULD BE A PRIORITY.DOWNLOAD

BACKGROUND: THE AUTHORS EXAMINED THE LABOR MARKET FOR REGISTERED DENTAL HYGIENISTS (RDHS) AND DENTAL ASSISTANTS (DAS) IN CALIFORNIA FROM 1997 TO 2005 TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE WAS A SHORTAGE IN EITHER MARKET.
METHODS: THIS ANALYSIS USED ECONOMIC INDICATORS INTERPRETED WITHIN AN ECONOMIC FRAMEWORK TO INVESTIGATE TRENDS IN LABOR FORCE NUMBERS AND MARKET-DETERMINED WAGES FOR RDHS AND DAS. RISING INFLATION-ADJUSTED MEAN WAGES INDICATED A LABOR SHORTAGE, WHILE DECLINING INFLATION-ADJUSTED MEAN WAGES INDICATED A LABOR SURPLUS.
RESULTS: FROM 1999 TO 2002, THE WAGES FOR RDHS INCREASED 48 PERCENT AND THEN STABILIZED, INDICATING A SHORTAGE HAD OCCURRED, AFTER WHICH THE MARKET ACHIEVED EQUILIBRIUM. WAGES FOR DAS INCREASED 13.9 PERCENT FROM 1997 TO 2001, BUT THEN DECLINED FROM 2001 TO 2005, INDICATING A SHORTAGE THAT THEN BECAME A SURPLUS. THE MARKET FOR DAS MAY NOT HAVE STABILIZED.
CONCLUSIONS: WAGES INCREASED FOR RDHS AND DAS, SUGGESTING THAT LABOR SHORTAGES OCCURRED IN BOTH MARKETS. THE LARGE SUPPLY RESPONSE IN THE MARKET FOR DAS RESULTED IN WAGES DECLINING AFTER THEIR INITIAL RISE.
PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: TRACKING THE LOCAL LABOR MARKETS FOR RDHS AND DAS WILL ENABLE DENTAL PROFESSIONALS TO RESPOND MORE EFFICIENTLY TO MARKET SIGNALS.

	WE SHOW THAT THE PROPORTION OF COMMUNITY SOCIAL CAPITAL ATTRIBUTABLE TO RELIGIOUS GROUPS IS INVERSELY AND STRONGLY RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF CIGARETTES THAT SMOKERS CONSUME. WE DO NOT FIND OVERALL COMMUNITY SOCIAL CAPITAL OR THE PROPORTION OF COMMUNITY SOCIAL CAPITAL ATTRIBUTABLE TO RELIGIOUS GROUPS TO BE RELATED TO THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF SMOKING. USING A NEW VALIDATED MEASURE OF COMMUNITY SOCIAL CAPITAL, THE PETRIS SOCIAL CAPITAL INDEX AND THREE YEARS (1998-2000) OF US DATA ON 39 369 ADULTS, WE ESTIMATE A TWO-PART DEMAND MODEL INCORPORATING THE FOLLOWING CONTROLS: COMMUNITY-LEVEL FIXED EFFECTS, PRICE (INCLUDING EXCISE TAXES), FAMILY INCOME, A SMUGGLING INDICATOR, NONSMOKING REGULATIONS, EDUCATION, MARITAL STATUS, SEX, AGE, AND RACE/ETHNICITY.

DATA SOURCES: 1998-1999 AND 2000-2001 COMMUNITY TRACKING STUDY PHYSICIAN SURVEYS AND HOUSEHOLD SURVEYS, 2000 U.S. CENSUS, AND THE AREA RESOURCE FILE.
STUDY DESIGN: POPULATION-AVERAGED REGRESSION MODELS WITH AREA-LEVEL FIXED EFFECTS WERE USED TO ESTIMATE THE DETERMINANTS OF LOG EARNINGS PER HOUR FOR PHYSICIANS IN A TWO-PERIOD PANEL (N=12,886). ALREC FOR A GIVEN RACIAL/ETHNIC GROUP IS MEASURED AS THE PERCENTAGE OF PHYSICIANS WHO ARE OF A GIVEN RACE/ETHNICITY LESS THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION WHO ARE OF THE CORRESPONDING RACE/ETHNICITY. RELEVANT CONTROL VARIABLES WERE INCLUDED.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: AVERAGE EARNINGS PER HOUR FOR HISPANIC AND ASIAN PHYSICIANS VARIES WITH THE DEGREE OF ALREC THAT CORRESPONDS TO A PHYSICIAN'S RACE/ETHNICITY. BOTH HISPANIC AND ASIAN PHYSICIANS EARN MORE PER HOUR IN AREAS WHERE CORRESPONDING ALREC IS NEGATIVE, OTHER THINGS EQUAL. ALREC VARIES FROM NEGATIVE TO POSITIVE FOR ALL GROUPS. ALREC FOR HISPANICS IS NEGATIVE, ON AVERAGE, DUE TO THE SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE THAT IS HISPANIC. THIS RESULTS IN AN AVERAGE 5.6 PERCENT EARNINGS-PER-HOUR PREMIUM FOR HISPANIC PHYSICIANS. HOWEVER, ALREC FOR ASIANS IS POSITIVE, ON AVERAGE, DUE TO THE LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE PHYSICIAN WORKFORCE THAT IS ASIAN. THIS RESULTS IN AN AVERAGE 4.0 PERCENT EARNINGS-PER-HOUR DISCOUNT FOR ASIAN PHYSICIANS. NO SIMILAR STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS WERE FOUND FOR BLACK PHYSICIANS.
CONCLUSIONS: THE MARKET-DETERMINED EARNINGS PER HOUR OF HISPANIC AND ASIAN PHYSICIANS ARE SENSITIVE TO THE DEGREE OF ALREC IN THE LOCAL LABOR MARKET. LARGER SAMPLE SIZES MAY BE NEEDED TO FIND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT RESULTS FOR BLACK PHYSICIANS.
SCHEFFLER, R., AND R. SMITH. “THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT DECENTRALIZATION ON HEALTH SPENDING FOR THE UNINSURED IN CALIFORNIA.” INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HEALTH CARE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS 6:3 (SEPT 2006): 237-258.
	WE ANALYZE PROGRAM REALIGNMENT, CALIFORNIA’S 1991 POLICY OF DECENTRALIZING CONTROL OF HEALTH, MENTAL HEALTH, AND SOCIAL SERVICES, FROM THE STATE TO THE COUNTIES. DRAWING FROM THE ECONOMICS LITERATURE ON INTERGOVERNMENTAL TRANSFERS AND USING DATA CONSTRUCTED FOR THIS STUDY, WE ANALYZE THE IMPACT OF REALIGNMENT ON UNINSURED HEALTH SPENDING. WE FIND A CHANGE IN THE PATTERN OF SPENDING ON INDIGENT HEALTH SERVICES BY COUNTIES FOLLOWING DECENTRALIZATION. OUR RESULTS SUGGEST, HOWEVER, THAT COUNTY-LEVEL GOVERNMENTS MAINTAIN A LEVEL OF COMMITMENT TO SOCIAL-SERVICE SPENDING THAT RECENT STUDIES INDICATE MAY BE LACKING AT THE STATE LEVEL.

	THE CONTINUED RISE IN U.S. HEALTHCARE SPENDING, ALONG WITH GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED, HAS SPURRED THE MOVE TOWARD CONSUMER-DRIVEN HEALTH PLANS. WE REVIEW NEW LEGISLATION COVERING SUCH PLANS, ANALYZE THEIR PENETRATION IN THE MARKETPLACE, AND PREDICT THEIR GROWTH. WE ALSO USE CURRENT INFORMATION ABOUT PLANS THAT ARE COMPATIBLE WITH HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS TO COMPARE THEM TO TRADITIONAL PREFERRED PROVIDER ORGANIZATION PLANS. NEXT, WE DISCUSS SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE PLANS ON VULNERABLE POPULATIONS, SUCH AS THE POOR AND SICK. FINALLY, WE SUGGEST HOW CONSUMER-DRIVEN HEALTH PLANS MAY HELP TO IMPROVE THE FUNCTIONING OF THE HEALTHCARE MARKET, ESPECIALLY BY PRODUCING MORE TRANSPARENT INFORMATION ON COST AND QUALITY.

IN ADDITION TO EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN SOCIAL CAPITAL AND HEALTH, WE TEST FOR INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN SOCIAL AND HUMAN CAPITAL IN THE PRODUCTION OF HEALTH. DATA COME FROM MORE THAN 10 000 ADULTS SURVEYED IN THE INDONESIAN FAMILY LIFE SURVEYS OF 1993 AND 1997. WE IDENTIFY A ROBUST POSITIVE EMPIRICAL ASSOCIATION BETWEEN COMMUNITY-LEVEL SOCIAL CAPITAL AND GOOD HEALTH. WE FIND WEAK EVIDENCE FOR AN INTERRELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HUMAN AND SOCIAL CAPITAL AND MENTAL HEALTH.

OBJECTIVE: TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF CHANGES IN RELATIVE HEALTH MAINTENANCE ORGANIZATION (HMO) PENETRATION ON CHANGES IN THE PHYSICIAN-TO-POPULATION RATIO IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES WHEN CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. AVERAGE ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT.
DATA SOURCES: DATA ON PHYSICIANS WHO PRACTICED IN CALIFORNIA AT ANY TIME FROM 1988 TO 1998 WERE OBTAINED FROM THE AMA MASTERFILE. THE ANALYSIS WAS RESTRICTED TO ACTIVE, PATIENT CARE PHYSICIANS, EXCLUDING MEDICAL RESIDENTS. DATA ON OTHER COVARIATES IN THE MODEL WERE OBTAINED FROM THE BUREAU OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS, INTERSTUDY, THE AREA RESOURCE FILE, AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE GOVERNMENT. DATA WERE MERGED USING COUNTY FIPS CODES.
STUDY DESIGN: CHANGES IN THE PHYSICIAN-TO-POPULATION RATIO IN CALIFORNIA COUNTIES INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF BOTH INTRASTATE MIGRATION AND INTERSTATE MIGRATION. A REDUCED-FORM MODEL WAS ESTIMATED USING THE ARELLANO-BOND DYNAMIC PANEL ESTIMATOR. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN CALIFORNIA RELATIVE TO THE U.S. WERE MEASURED AS THE RATIO OF COUNTY-LEVEL REAL PER CAPITA INCOME TO NATIONAL-LEVEL REAL PER CAPITA INCOME. RELATIVE HMO PENETRATION IN CALIFORNIA WAS MEASURED AS THE RATIO OF COUNTY-LEVEL HMO PENETRATION TO HMO PENETRATION IN THE U.S. RELATIVE HMO PENETRATION WAS INSTRUMENTED USING FIVE IDENTIFYING VARIABLES TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL ENDOGENEITY. OMITTED-VARIABLE BIAS WAS CONTROLLED FOR BY FIRST DIFFERENCING THE MODEL. THE MODEL ALSO INCORPORATED EIGHT OTHER COVARIATES THAT MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEMAND FOR PHYSICIANS: THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION ENROLLED IN MEDICAID, BEDS IN SHORT-TERM HOSPITALS PER 100,000 POPULATION, THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT IS BLACK, THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT IS HISPANIC, THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT IS ASIAN, THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT IS BELOW AGE 18, THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT IS AGED 65 AND OLDER, AND THE PERCENTAGE OF THE POPULATION THAT ARE NEW LEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN A GIVEN YEAR. ALL OF THE ABOVE VARIABLES WERE LAGGED ONE PERIOD. THE LAGGED PHYSICIAN-TO-POPULATION RATIO WAS ALSO INCLUDED TO CONTROL FOR THE SUPPLY OF PHYSICIANS. SEPARATE EQUATIONS WERE ESTIMATED FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALIST PHYSICIANS.
PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: CHANGES IN LAGGED RELATIVE HMO PENETRATION ARE NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN SPECIALIST PHYSICIANS PER 100,000 POPULATION. HOWEVER, THIS EFFECT OF HMO PENETRATION IS ATTENUATED AND AT TIMES REVERSED IN AREAS WHERE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DIFFERENCE IN RELATIVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IS SUFFICIENTLY LARGE. WE DID NOT FIND ANY STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS.
CONCLUSIONS: CONSISTENT WITH PRIOR STUDIES, WE FIND THAT CHANGES IN PHYSICIAN SUPPLY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN RELATIVE HMO PENETRATION. RELATIVE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE AN IMPORTANT MODERATOR OF THE EFFECT OF CHANGES IN RELATIVE HMO PENETRATION ON PHYSICIAN MIGRATION.

	THE AUTHORS DISCUSS THE CHANGING ROLE OF THE ANTITRUST POLICY IN TODAY’S HEALTH CARE MARKETS AND POSSIBLE FUTURE ENVIRONMENTS. THE ANTITRUST CHALLENGES TODAY LIE IN MAINTAINING COMPETITION WHEN HOSPITALS MERGE OR BARGAIN AS MULTI-HOSPITAL SYSTEMS, PROVIDING ACCESS IN AREAS WITH HIGH CONCENTRATION OF HOSPITAL CLOSURES, INCORPORATING QUALITY INTO THE MEASURES OF MARKET POWER. THE ROLE OF QUALITY COMPETITION MAY BECOME MORE IMPORTANT IN THE FUTURE SCENARIOS SUCH AS SINGLE PAYER SYSTEM UNDER FIXED PRICES.DOWNLOAD

	A JOINT WHARTON SCHOOL-WORLD BANK CONFERENCE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE HIGH PROPORTIONS OF MEDICAL CARE SPENDING PAID OUT OF POCKET IN MOST DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THIS, ATTENDEES SAID, IS THE PROBLEM IN SUCH ECONOMIES OF GENERATING HIGH TAX REVENUES IN A NONDISTORTIVE WAY. SINCE PEOPLE ARE PAYING OUT OF POCKET, THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD SOME PRIVATE INSURANCE THAT CAN SPREAD THE RISK OF ABOVE-AVERAGE OUT-OF-POCKET PAYMENTS. THE POTENTIAL EFFICIENCY GAINS FROM GREATER USE OF VOLUNTARY PRIVATE INSURANCE SEEM LARGE, BUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF POSSIBLE IMPEDIMENTS TO THE EMERGENCE OF SUCH INSURANCE.
	KIRBY, P., AND R.M. SCHEFFLER. “CHANGES IN SERVICE AVAILABILITY IN CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS, 1995 TO  2002.” JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE MANAGEMENT 51.1 (JAN./FEB. 2006).
	HOSPITALS FACE SERIOUS FINANCIAL CHALLENGES IN THE CURRENT HEALTHCARE MARKETPLACE. IN RESPONSE TO THESE CHALLENGES, THEY MAY ALTER THEIR SERVICE OFFERINGS, ELIMINATING SERVICES THAT ARE PERCEIVED AS MONEY-LOSING OR ADDING NEW SERVICES IN AREAS WHERE PROFITABILITY IS EXPECTED TO BE GREATER. ALTHOUGH RESEARCH HAS EXAMINED HOSPITAL CLOSURES, THE MORE SUBTLE PHENOMENON OF HOSPITAL SERVICE CHANGES HAS NOT BEEN SYSTEMATICALLY STUDIED. THIS ISSUE IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE DIFFERENT TYPES OF HOSPITAL SERVICE CHANGES COULD HAVE DIFFERENT EFFECTS ON HOSPITAL FINANCIAL VIABILITY: EXTENSIVE SERVICE CLOSURES COULD CONTRIBUTE TO A DOWNWARD SPIRAL LEADING TO HOSPITAL CLOSURE, WHEREAS ADDING NEW SERVICES MIGHT HELP IMPROVE A HOSPITAL'S FINANCES. THIS ARTICLE' EXAMINES CHANGES IN HOSPITAL SERVICE AVAILABILITY IN CALIFORNIA GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS BETWEEN 1995 AND 2002. OUR MAJOR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT MANY CALIFORNIA HOSPITALS MADE CHANGES IN THEIR SERVICE OFFERINGS DURING THE STUDY PERIOD, ALTHOUGH FEW MADE EXTENSIVE CHANGES. ALTOGETHER, ABOUT HALF OF THE HOSPITALS IN OUR STUDY POPULATION EITHER CLOSED OR OPENED AT LEAST ONE SERVICE. NEARLY ONE-FOURTH OF THE HOSPITALS IN OUR STUDY POPULATION CLOSED ONE OR MORE SERVICES, WHEREAS JUST UNDER ONE-THIRD OPENED ONE OR MORE NEW SERVICES. HOWEVER, THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE HOSPITALS THAT CLOSED OR ADDED A SERVICE MADE ONLY ONE OR TWO SUCH CHANGES. IN ADDITION, FEW HOSPITALS BOTH CLOSED AND OPENED SERVICES. THE SERVICE CLOSED MOST FREQUENTLY WAS NORMAL NEWBORN LABOR AND DELIVERY (OBSTETRICS), WHEREAS INPATIENT REHABILITATION WAS THE MOST FREQUENTLY OPENED SERVICE. HOSPITALS THAT MADE THE MOST SERVICE CHANGES TENDED TO BE SMALL, RURAL, AND FINANCIALLY TROUBLED AT THE START OF THE STUDY PERIOD. AMONG THIS GROUP OF HOSPITALS, SERVICE CLOSURES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH CONTINUED FINANCIAL DETERIORATION, WHEREAS NEW SERVICE OPENINGS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN KEY FINANCIAL RATIOS.

BACKGROUND: PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE DOCUMENTED SEX AND RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN OUTCOMES AFTER ACUTE MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION (AMI), BUT THE EXPLANATION OF THESE DISPARITIES REMAINS LIMITED. IN A SETTING THAT CONTROLS FOR ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE, WE EVALUATED WHETHER SEX AND RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN PROGNOSIS AFTER AMI PERSIST AFTER CONSIDERATION OF SOCIOECONOMIC BACKGROUND, PERSONAL MEDICAL HISTORY, AND MEDICAL MANAGEMENT.
METHODS: WE CONDUCTED A PROSPECTIVE COHORT STUDY OF THE MEMBERS (20,263 MEN AND 10,061 WOMEN) OF AN INTEGRATED HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHO HAD EXPERIENCED AN AMI BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 1995, AND DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND WERE FOLLOWED UP FOR A MEDIAN OF 3.5 YEARS (MAXIMUM, 8 YEARS). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES INCLUDED AMI RECURRENCE AND ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY.
RESULTS:  IN AGE-ADJUSTED ANALYSES RELATIVE TO WHITE MEN, BLACK MEN (HAZARD RATIO [HR], 1.44; 95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL [CI], 1.26-1.65), BLACK WOMEN (HR, 1.47; 95% CI, 1.26-1.72), AND ASIAN WOMEN (HR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.13-1.65) WERE AT INCREASED RISK OF AMI RECURRENCE. HOWEVER, MULTIVARIATE ADJUSTMENT FOR SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC BACKGROUND, COMORBIDITIES, MEDICATION USE, ANGIOGRAPHY, AND REVASCULARIZATION PROCEDURES EFFECTIVELY REMOVED THE EXCESS RISK OF AMI RECURRENCE IN THESE 3 GROUPS. SIMILARLY, THE INCREASED AGE-ADJUSTED RISK OF ALL-CAUSE MORTALITY SEEN IN BLACK MEN (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.37-1.75) AND BLACK WOMEN (HR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.27-1.66) WAS GREATLY ATTENUATED IN BLACK MEN AND REVERSED IN BLACK WOMEN AFTER FULL MULTIVARIATE ADJUSTMENT.
CONCLUSION: IN A POPULATION WITH EQUAL ACCESS TO MEDICAL CARE, COMPREHENSIVE CONSIDERATION OF SOCIAL, PERSONAL, AND MEDICAL FACTORS COULD EXPLAIN SEX AND RACIAL/ETHNIC DISPARITIES IN PROGNOSIS AFTER AMI.

	RECENT SURVEYS AMONG PSYCHOLOGISTS AND HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS OF THE PROFESSION DOCUMENT IMPORTANT PRACTICE PATTERN DIFFERENCES AMONG PSYCHOLOGISTS ON THE BASIS OF YEARS OF POSTLICENSURE EXPERIENCE. EVIDENCE FOR THESE DIFFERENCES ACROSS 4 GROUPS OF PSYCHOLOGISTS WAS EXAMINED FROM RESPONSES TO THE 2000 CALIFORNIA SURVEY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PRACTICE. PSYCHOLOGISTS WITH FEWER THAN 5 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE WERE FOUND TO TREAT ON A WEEKLY BASIS A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WITH CHILDHOOD DISORDERS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS AND TO SPEND A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF PRACTICE TIME IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND/OR MENTAL HEALTH SETTINGS THAN OTHER PSYCHOLOGISTS. NO DIFFERENCES WERE FOUND IN THE USE OF 3 DOMINANT FORMS OF PSYCHOTHERAPY. THE IMPLICATIONS OF THESE RESULTS FOR PRACTICING PSYCHOLOGISTS, GRADUATE FACULTY AND STUDENTS, AND REPRESENTATIVES OF STATE PSYCHOLOGICAL ASSOCIATIONS ARE DISCUSSED.

	THIS ARTICLE ASSESSES HOW THE INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT OF DECISION MAKING ON THREE-JUDGE PANELS OF THE FEDERAL COURT OF APPEALS AFFECTS THE IMPACT THAT GENDER AND RACE HAVE ON JUDICIAL DECISIONS. OUR CENTRAL QUESTION IS WHETHER AND HOW RACIAL MINORITY AND WOMEN JUDGES INFLUENCE LEGAL POLICY ON ISSUES THOUGHT TO BE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO WOMEN AND MINORITIES WHEN SERVING ON APPELLATE PANELS WHICH DECIDE CASES BY MAJORITY RULE. PROPER ANALYSIS OF THIS QUESTION REQUIRES INVESTIGATING WHETHER WOMEN AND MINORITY JUDGES INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF OTHER PANEL MEMBERS. WE FIND THAT THE NORM OF UNANIMITY ON PANELS GRANTS WOMEN INFLUENCE OVER OUTCOMES EVEN WHEN THEY ARE OUTNUMBERED ON A PANEL.DOWNLOAD

	THIRTY-FOUR STATES HAVE ENACTE MENTAL HEALTH PARITY LAWS THAT REQUIRE A HEALTH PLAN, INSURER, OR EMPLOYER TO PROVIDE COVERAGE FOR MENTAL ILLNESS EQUAL TO THAT FOR PHYSICAL ILLNESS. THIS STUDY ANALYZED DEFINITIONS OF MENTAL ILLNESS USED IN STATE PARITY LAWS, IDENTIFIED FACTORS INFLUENCING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE DEFINITIONS, AND EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS ON ACCESS TO CARE FOR PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS.
METHODS: SPECIFIC LANGUAGE IN EACH STATE'S PARITY LEGISLATION WAS ANALYZED. INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH POLICY MAKERS, MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS, ADVOCATES, AND INSURERS TO DETERMINE FACTORS INFLUENCING A STATE'S DEFINITION. CURRENT DEFINITIONS OF MENTAL ILLNESS USED IN THE CLINICAL LITERATURE AND IN FEDERAL POLICY WERE REVIEWED AND COMPARED WITH DEFINITIONS USED IN STATE PARITY LAWS.
RESULTS: THE DEFINITIONS OF MENTAL ILLNESS USED IN STATE PARITY LEGISLATION VARY SIGNIFICANTLY AND FALL INTO ONE OF THREE MAJOR CATEGORIES: ""BROAD-BASED MENTAL ILLNESS,"" ""SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS,"" OR ""BIOLOGICALLY BASED MENTAL ILLNESS."" TO DEFINE EACH OF THESE CATEGORIES, STATE LEGISLATURES DO NOT RELY ON CLINICALLY ACCEPTED DEFINITIONS OR FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH POLICY. RATHER, INFLUENCED BY POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FACTORS, THEY ARE DEVELOPING THEIR OWN DEFINITIONS.
CONCLUSIONS: DEFINITIONS OF MENTAL ILLNESS IN STATE PARITY LAWS HAVE IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS FOR ACCESS, COST, AND REIMBURSEMENT; THEY DETERMINE WHICH POPULATIONS RECEIVE A HIGHER LEVEL OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FUTURE RESEARCH MUST QUALITATIVELY EXAMINE HOW STATE DEFINITIONS AFFECT THE USE AND COST OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

	THIS STUDY WAS CONDUCTED TO EXAMINE THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN PSYCHIATRISTS' DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, PAYMENT SOURCE, AND MANAGED CARE PARTICIPATION AND PSYCHIATRISTS' PRACTICE WORKLOAD, AND BETWEEN THE SUPPLY OF OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS IN A PSYCHIATRIST'S COUNTY OF PRACTICE AND PSYCHIATRISTS' PRACTICE WORKLOAD. DATA FROM THE 1996 AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION NATIONAL SURVEY OF PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE WERE MERGED WITH NATIONAL COUNTYWIDE MEASURES OF MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL DATA FROM THE 1996 AREA RESOURCE FILE. IN COMPARISON TO MALE PSYCHIATRISTS, FEMALE PSYCHIATRISTS TREAT FEWER PATIENTS PER WEEK, PROVIDE LESS TOTAL HOURS OF WEEKLY PATIENT CARE, AND OBTAIN FEWER NEW MONTHLY REFERRALS. AN INCREASE IN PSYCHIATRISTS' MANAGED CARE PARTICIPATION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH ONLY MINOR INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS PER WEEK, WEEKLY TIME SPENT IN CLINICAL CARE, AND NUMBER OF NEW MONTHLY REFERRALS. THE SUPPLY OF OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WAS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH VARIATION IN PRACTICE WORKLOAD. ONCE PSYCHIATRISTS PARTICIPATE IN MANAGED CARE PLANS, AN INCREASE IN THEIR PARTICIPATION RATE DOES NOT SIGNIFICANTLY EXPAND CLINICAL PRACTICE WORKLOAD. THE SUPPLY OF OTHER MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH VARIATION IN PSYCHIATRISTS' WORKLOAD, WHICH SUGGESTS THAT SUBSTITUTION EFFECTS MAY NOT BE EVIDENT WITH THIS ASPECT OF PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE.

OBJECTIVE: THE AUTHORS COMPARED DATA FROM PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS IN CALIFORNIA TO DETERMINE WHETHER LONG-STANDING DIFFERENCES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE REMAIN AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF MANAGED CARE AND OTHER CHANGES IN MENTAL SERVICE DELIVERY.
METHODS: RESPONSES FROM PRACTICING CLINICIANS IN CALIFORNIA WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE 1998 NATIONAL SURVEY OF PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE AND THE 2000 CALIFORNIA SURVEY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PRACTICE WERE COMPARED ON ITEMS RELATED TO PATIENT CASELOAD, PRACTICE PROFILE, AND INSURANCE OR REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENTS.
RESULTS: DATA FROM 97 PSYCHIATRISTS AND 395 PSYCHOLOGISTS WERE AVAILABLE FOR THE STUDY. PSYCHIATRISTS REPORTED SPENDING MORE HOURS ON MOST ASPECTS OF PRACTICE AND WORKING MORE TOTAL HOURS PER WEEK THAN PSYCHOLOGISTS. THE WEEKLY CASELOADS REPORTED BY PSYCHIATRISTS INCLUDED A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF PERSONS TREATED FOR PSYCHOTIC CONDITIONS THAN DID THE CASELOADS OF PSYCHOLOGISTS. PSYCHOLOGISTS REPORTED THAT THEIR WEEKLY CASELOADS INCLUDED A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF PERSONS TREATED FOR ANXIETY DISORDERS, PERSONALITY DISORDERS, AND OTHER DISORDERS. PSYCHIATRISTS REPORTED RECEIVING A GREATER AVERAGE PAYMENT FOR SERVICES FROM PUBLIC INSURANCE, AND PSYCHOLOGISTS REPORTED TREATING A GREATER AVERAGE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE. SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN INCOME SOURCES AND FEE ARRANGEMENTS WERE OBSERVED, AND THE NET REPORTED INCOME OF PSYCHIATRISTS WAS NEARLY 80 PERCENT GREATER THAN THAT OF PSYCHOLOGISTS.
CONCLUSIONS: LONG-STANDING DIFFERENCES IN CLINICAL PRACTICE PATTERNS REMAIN BETWEEN PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS DESPITE MANAGED CARE STAFFING ARRANGEMENTS AND TREATMENT STRATEGIES THAT STREAMLINE THE PRACTICES OF BOTH PROVIDER GROUPS. THE SIGNIFICANT INCOME AND WAGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PSYCHIATRISTS AND PSYCHOLOGISTS MAY BE PARTLY DUE TO SUPPLY DYNAMICS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT PSYCHOLOGISTS.

	AFFECTIVE DISORDERS IMPOSE A SUBSTANTIAL INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIETAL BURDEN. DESPITE AVAILABILITY OF EFFICACIOUS TREATMENTS AND PRACTICE GUIDELINES, UNMET NEED REMAINS HIGH. TO REDUCE UNMET NEED AND THE BURDEN OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS, INFORMATION IS NEEDED ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF BURDEN ACROSS STAKEHOLDERS, ON BARRIERS TO REDUCING BURDEN, AND ON INTERVENTIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY REDUCE BURDEN AT THE LEVELS OF PRACTICE, COMMUNITY, AND POLICY. THIS ARTICLE PROVIDES THE REPORT OF THE WORKING GROUP ON OVERCOMING BARRIERS TO REDUCING THE BURDEN OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS, FOR THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF MENTAL HEALTH STRATEGIC PLAN ON MOOD DISORDERS. WE REVIEW THE LITERATURE, IDENTIFY KEY GAPS, AND RECOMMEND NEW RESEARCH TO GUIDE NATIONAL EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE BURDEN OF AFFECTIVE DISORDERS.

	THIS STUDY EXAMINED WHETHER DECENTRALIZATION OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM UNDER PROGRAM REALIGNMENT HAS CHANGED THE COMPOSITION OF THE CLIENT POPULATION, WITH GREATER ATTENTION TOWARD INCLUSION OF PERSONS WITH A SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS. CLIENTS' DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL STATUS WERE COMPARED BEFORE AND AFTER REALIGNMENT. THE STUDY SAMPLE CONSISTED OF 75,951 CLIENTS, REPRESENTING 1.5 MILLION ADULTS WHO ACCESSED THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA DURING A 6-YEAR STUDY PERIOD. THE POST-REALIGNMENT CLIENT POPULATION HAD LOWER FUNCTIONAL STATUS, MORE UNEMPLOYMENT, AND LOWER LEVELS OF EDUCATION-ALL INDICATING GREATER FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT. THEY WERE MORE LIKELY TO SUFFER FROM AN AFFECTIVE DISORDER, BUT THEY WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE EITHER A NON-PSYCHOTIC DISORDER OR SCHIZOPHRENIA. THE STUDY FOUND NO EVIDENCE SUGGESTING THAT REALIGNMENT JEOPARDIZED ACCESS TO THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA, AND IT INDICATED AT LEAST THE POSSIBILITY THAT IT PROMOTED GREATER ACCESS BY CLIENTS WITH GREATER FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT.

	DECENTRALIZATION OF CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM UNDER PROGRAM REALIGNMENT HAS CHANGED THE UTILIZATION AND COST OF COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THIS STUDY EXAMINED A SAMPLE OF 75,951 USERS, REPRESENTING 1.5 MILLION ADULTS WHO VISITED CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DURING A 6-YEAR PERIOD (FY 1988-1990 AND FY 1992-1994). REGRESSION ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED TO EXAMINE COST AND UTILIZATION REDUCTION OVER TIME, ACROSS REGIONS, AND ACROSS PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSES. OVERALL UTILIZATION AND COST OF COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REALIGNMENT. THEY WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER FOR (A) 24-HOUR SERVICES IN THE URBAN INDUSTRIALIZED SOUTHERN REGION AND (B) OUTPATIENT SERVICES IN THE AGRICULTURAL CENTRAL REGION OF THE STATE. USERS DIAGNOSED WITH MOOD DISORDERS TOOK A GREATER PORTION, BUT WERE ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS TREATMENT AND COST THAN OTHER USERS IN THE POST-REALIGNMENT PERIOD. WHEN LOCAL COMMUNITIES BEAR THE FINANCIAL RISKS AND REWARDS, THEY FIND MORE EFFICIENT METHODS OF DELIVERING COMMUNITY-BASED MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

	THE CALIFORNIA SURVEY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PRACTICE PROVIDES COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON PATIENT CASE MIX, TREATMENTS, PRACTICE SETTINGS, AND PAYMENT SOURCES USING A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF PSYCHOLOGISTS. THESE PSYCHOLOGISTS PRACTICE IN DIVERSE SETTINGS AND CONTINUE TO DELIVER TRADITIONAL PSYCHOTHERAPIES. CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGISTS' TREATMENT OF PERSONS WITH PRIVATE INSURANCE HIGHLIGHTS THE PROFESSION'S PUBLIC HEALTH CONTRIBUTION BY IMPROVING THE FUNCTIONING OF EMPLOYED PERSONS AND THEIR FAMILIES. DESPITE HIGH MANAGED CARE ENROLLMENT AMONG CALIFORNIANS, THESE PSYCHOLOGISTS DEMONSTRATE WIDE VARIABILITY IN MANAGED CARE PARTICIPATION. THE AUTHORS COMPARE THE FINDINGS TO PRIOR SURVEYS AMONG PSYCHOLOGISTS AND DISCUSS THE FINDINGS IN RELATION TO TRENDS IN PSYCHOLOGICAL PRACTICE AND PUBLIC POLICY.

	DATA FROM THE 2000 CALFFORNIA SURVEY OF PSYCHOLOGICAL PRACTICE (D. PINGITORE, R. SCHEFFLER, M. HALEY, T. SENTELL, & D. SCHWALM, 2001) WERE USED TO MEASURE PSYCHOLOGISTS' INCOME VARIATION ASSOCIATED WITH DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS, MANAGED CARE PARTICIPATION RATE, AND MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE SUPPLY CONCENTRATIONS. A 10% INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF PSYCHOLOGISTS IN A PSYCHOLOGISTS' MARKET OF PRACTICE RESULTED IN A $1,749 REDUCTION IN INCOME COMPARED WITH A $1,330 INCOME REDUCTION DUE TO A 10% INCREASE IN MANAGED CARE PARTICIPATION. THE AUTHORS DISCUSS HOW PSYCHOLOGISTS' INCOME AND OTHER ASPECTS OF PRACTICE ARE SHAPED BY MARKET DYNAMICS, TRENDS IN THE PSYCHOLOGIST WORKFORCE, AND PUBLIC POLICY.SENTELL, T., D.P.

	INCOME, AN IMPORTANT FACET OF PROFESSIONAL PSYCHOLOGICAL PRACTICE, DIFFERS BY GENDER. THE POTENTIAL SOURCES OF INCOME DIFFERENCES AMONG CALIFORNIA CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGISTS WERE INVESTIGATED. FULL-TIME FEMALE PSYCHOLOGISTS EARNED SIGNIFICANTLY LESS INCOME ON AVERAGE THAN FULL-TIME MALE PSYCHOLOGISTS, DESPITE SIMILAR PATIENT DEMOGRAPHICS, CASELOADS, PRACTICE PROFILES, AND PAYMENT SOURCES. IN SEPARATE REGRESSION MODELS, PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE INCREASED INCOME MORE FOR MEN THAN FOR WOMEN, WHEREAS GREATER PSYCHOLOGIST SUPPLY DECREASED INCOME FOR BOTH GROUPS. ACCORDING TO THE REGRESSION MODEL, IF FEMALE PSYCHOLOGISTS WERE PAID LIKE MALE PSYCHOLOGISTS, THEY WOULD RECEIVE, ON AVERAGE

	THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES THE IMPACT OF ""PROGRAM REALIGNMENT,"" A 1991 CALIFORNIA STATE POLICY THAT SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCED LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' FINANCIAL RISK AND PROGRAMMATIC AUTHORITY FOR PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES, ON TREATMENT COSTS PER USER, AND ON THE MIX OF INPATIENT AND OUTPATIENT SERVICE COSTS. THE STUDY EMPLOYS A NATURAL PRE-REALIGNMENT AND POST-REALIGNMENT DESIGN USING THE 59 CALIFORNIA LOCAL MENTAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES (LMHAS) AS THE UNIT OF ANALYSIS OVER A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD SPANNING POLICY IMPLEMENTATION. TOTAL TREATMENT AND INPATIENT COST PER USER DECREASES AND OUTPATIENT COST PER USER INCREASES AFTER PROGRAM REALIGNMENT. HIGHER LEVELS OF CONTRACTING WITH PRIVATE PROVIDERS TEND TO ENHANCE THIS TREND, WHILE RISK FOR INSTITUTIONAL SERVICES REDUCES USER COSTS UNIFORMLY. FINANCIAL AND PROGRAMMATIC DECENTRALIZATION CAN ENHANCE COST EFFICIENCY IN TREATMENT, WHILE PROMOTING SUBSTITUTION OF OUTPATIENT SERVICES FOR INPATIENT SERVICES. LOCAL CONDITIONS SUCH AS RISK AND CONTRACTING DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE POLICY RESPONSE.

	THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES THE EXTENT OF MANAGED CARE AND FEE DISCOUNTING IN PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE USING DATA ON 970 RANDOMLY SAMPLED AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION MEMBERS FROM THE 1996 NATIONAL SURVEY OF PSYCHIATRIC PRACTICE. SEVENTY PERCENT OF PSYCHIATRISTS WERE FOUND TO HAVE SOME PATIENTS IN MANAGED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE SURVEY DATA ILLUSTRATE THAT PSYCHIATRISTS' INVOLVEMENT IN MANAGED CARE SPANS PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTINGS AND IS FAIRLY EVENLY DISTRIBUTED ACROSS REGIONS OF THE UNITED STATES. NATIONALLY, PSYCHIATRISTS DISCOUNT FEES FOR 35% OF THEIR PATIENTS, WITH SIGNIFICANT VARIATION BY PRACTICE TYPE AND EXTENT OF INVOLVEMENT IN MANAGED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE. THE AVERAGE LEVEL OF DISCOUNT IS 25% WITH LITTLE VARIATION BY PRACTICE TYPE OR EXTENT OF INVOLVEMENT IN MANAGED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE. THERE IS LITTLE EVIDENCE THAT PSYCHIATRISTS WITH PATIENTS IN MANAGED CARE HAVE HIGHER FEE LEVELS THAN PSYCHIATRISTS WITH NO PATIENTS IN MANAGED CARE.

	USING NATIONAL DATA AND THE MOST RECENT OECD FIGURES, WE PROVIDE AN UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF THE SPANISH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AND ITS REFORMS. WE COMPARE FIGURES FROM SPAIN WITH OTHER MAJOR INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS AND FIND THAT THE SPANISH SYSTEM APPEARS MACRO-ECONOMICALLY EFFICIENT AND EQUITABLE. HOWEVER, LIKE MANY OTHER COUNTRIES IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, THE SPANISH HEALTH CARE SYSTEM CONFRONTS CONTINUED PRESSURES TO PROVIDE HIGH-QUALITY UNIVERSAL CARE IN THE FACE OF EVER INCREASING COSTS AND COMPETING USES FOR FINANCIAL RESOURCES. THESE PRESSURES HAVE PROMPTED THE ENACTMENT OF SEVERAL REFORMS, WHICH ARE REVIEWED. WE DRAW FROM THE AMERICAN EXPERIENCE WITH MANAGED CARE AND MANAGED COMPETITION TO ILLUSTRATE POSSIBLE PATHS FOR FURTHER REFORM.

HIS FIRST BOOK, LEADERSHIP WITHOUT EASY ANSWERS (1994), IS A CLASSIC IN THE FIELD AND ONE OF THE TEN MOST ASSIGNED COURSE BOOKS AT HARVARD AND DUKE UNIVERSITIES.  HEIFETZ CO-AUTHORED THE BEST-SELLING LEADERSHIP ON THE LINE: STAYING ALIVE THROUGH THE DANGERS OF CHANGE WITH MARTY LINSKY, WHICH SERVES AS ONE OF THE PRIMARY GO-TO BOOKS FOR PRACTITIONERS ACROSS SECTORS (2002, REVISED 2017).  HE THEN CO-AUTHORED THE FIELD BOOK, THE PRACTICE OF ADAPTIVE LEADERSHIP: TOOLS AND TACTICS FOR CHANGING YOUR ORGANIZATION AND THE WORLD WITH ALEXANDER GRASHOW AND MARTY LINSKY (2009).HEIFETZ BEGAN HIS FOCUS ON TRANSFORMATIVE METHODS OF LEADERSHIP EDUCATION AND DEVELOPMENT IN 1983. DRAWING STUDENTS FROM THROUGHOUT HARVARD’S GRADUATE SCHOOLS AND NEIGHBORING UNIVERSITIES, HIS COURSES ON LEADERSHIP ARE LEGENDARY; HIS CORE COURSE IS CONSIDERED THE MOST INFLUENTIAL IN THEIR CAREER BY KENNEDY SCHOOL ALUMNI. HIS TEACHING METHODS HAVE BEEN STUDIED EXTENSIVELY IN DOCTORAL DISSERTATIONS AND IN LEADERSHIP CAN BE TAUGHT, BY SHARON DALOZ PARKS (2005).A GRADUATE OF COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY, HARVARD MEDICAL SCHOOL, AND THE KENNEDY SCHOOL, HEIFETZ IS BOTH A PHYSICIAN AND CELLIST. HE TRAINED INITIALLY IN SURGERY BEFORE DECIDING TO DEVOTE HIMSELF TO THE STUDY OF LEADERSHIP IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS, BUSINESS, AND NONPROFITS. HEIFETZ COMPLETED HIS MEDICAL TRAINING IN PSYCHIATRY, WHICH PROVIDED A FOUNDATION TO DEVELOP MORE POWERFUL TEACHING METHODS AND GAVE HIM A DISTINCT PERSPECTIVE ON THE CONCEPTUAL TOOLS OF POLITICAL PSYCHOLOGY AND ORGANIZATIONAL BEHAVIOR. AS A CELLIST, HE WAS PRIVILEGED TO STUDY WITH THE GREAT RUSSIAN VIRTUOSO, GREGOR PIATIGORSKY.|HARVARD KENNEDY SCHOOL

NEW YORK, NY: BASIC BOOKS AND RUSSELL SAGE FOUNDATION PRESS.MANY AMERICANS BELIEVE THAT THE RACIAL INTEGRATION OF US SCHOOLS WAS A SOCIAL EXPERIMENT DOOMED FROM THE START. BUT IN FACT, ECONOMIST RUCKER C. JOHNSON CONTENDS, SCHOOL INTEGRATION EFFORTS IN THE 1970S AND 1980S WERE OVERWHELMINGLY SUCCESSFUL, AND OUR RETREAT FROM THEM HAS HAD DIRE EFFECTS ON OUR SOCIETY. IN CHILDREN OF THE DREAM, JOHNSON UNEARTHS THE ASTONISHING TRUTH ABOUT INTEGRATION’S SPECTACULAR ACHIEVEMENT IN AMERICA. DRAWING ON ORIGINAL LONGITUDINAL STUDIES GOING BACK TO THE 1960S, HE SHOWS THAT STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED INTEGRATED AND WELL-FUNDED SCHOOLS WERE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN LIFE THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT—AND THAT THIS HOLDS TRUE FOR CHILDREN OF ALL RACES. INDEED, JOHNSON'S RESEARCH SHOWS THAT SUCH SCHOOLS WERE NOTHING LESS THAN THE PRIMARY ENGINE OF SOCIAL MOBILITY IN THE DECADES AFTER THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. YET IN THE FACE OF RACIAL BACKLASH, AMERICA GAVE UP ON INTEGRATION. SINCE THE HIGHPOINT OF INTEGRATION IN 1988, WE HAVE REGRESSED, AND SEGREGATION AGAIN PREVAILS.   EXPLAINING WHY INTEGRATION WORKED, WHY IT WAS ABANDONED, AND HOW IT CAN BE REVIVED TO THE BENEFIT OF ALL, CHILDREN OF THE DREAM OFFERS A RADICAL NEW PERSPECTIVE ON AMERICAN SOCIAL POLICY. IT IS ESSENTIAL READING IN OUR DIVIDED TIMES.FIND IT ON AMAZON.JOHNSON, RUCKER C. AND C.

IV AND SIBLING-DIFFERENCE ESTIMATES INDICATE THAT, FOR POOR CHILDREN, THESE POLICIES BOTH INCREASED EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT AND EARNINGS, AND REDUCED POVERTY AND INCARCERATION. THE BENEFITS OF HEAD START WERE LARGER WHEN FOLLOWED BY ACCESS TO BETTER-FUNDED SCHOOLS, AND INCREASES IN K12 SPENDING WERE MORE EFFICACIOUS WHEN PRECEDED BY HEAD START EXPOSURE. THE FINDINGS SUGGEST DYNAMIC COMPLEMENTARITIES, IMPLYING THAT EARLY EDUCATIONAL INVESTMENTS THAT ARE SUSTAINED MAY BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY.DOWNLOAD

I PROVIDE NEW EVIDENCE ON THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF SCHOOL SPENDING FROM TITLE I ON CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL AND ADULT ECONOMIC OUTCOMES. TO STUDY EFFECTS OF TITLE I, I LINK SCHOOL DISTRICT SPENDING AND ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ON TITLE I FUNDING TO NATIONALLY-REPRESENTATIVE DATA ON CHILDREN BORN BETWEEN 1950 AND 1977 AND FOLLOWED THROUGH 2011. MODELS INCLUDE CONTROLS FOR BIRTH COHORT AND SCHOOL DISTRICT FIXED EFFECTS, CHILDHOOD FAMILY AND NEIGHBORHOOD CHARACTERISTICS, AND OTHER POLICIES. I FIND THAT INCREASES IN TITLE I FUNDING ARE SIGNIFICANTLY RELATED TO INCREASES IN EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT, HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION RATES, HIGHER EARNINGS AND WORK HOURS, REDUCTIONS IN GRADE REPETITION, SCHOOL SUSPENSION/EXPULSION, INCARCERATION, AND REDUCTIONS IN THE ANNUAL INCIDENCE OF POVERTY IN ADULTHOOD; EFFECTS ON EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES ARE MORE PRONOUNCED FOR POOR CHILDREN.DOWNLOAD

JOHNSON, CLAUDIA PERSICO (2015). “THE EFFECTS OF SCHOOL SPENDING ON EDUCATIONAL & ECONOMIC OUTCOMES: EVIDENCE FROM SCHOOL FINANCE REFORMS”. THE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 131(1): 157-218.SINCE THE COLEMAN REPORT, MANY HAVE QUESTIONED WHETHER PUBLIC SCHOOL SPENDING AFFECTS STUDENT OUTCOMES. THE SCHOOL FINANCE REFORMS THAT BEGAN IN THE EARLY 1970S AND ACCELERATED IN THE 1980S CAUSED DRAMATIC CHANGES TO THE STRUCTURE OF K–12 EDUCATION SPENDING IN THE UNITED STATES. TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF THESE SCHOOL FINANCE REFORM–INDUCED CHANGES IN PUBLIC SCHOOL SPENDING ON LONG-RUN ADULT OUTCOMES, WE LINK SCHOOL SPENDING AND SCHOOL FINANCE REFORM DATA TO DETAILED, NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA ON CHILDREN BORN BETWEEN 1955 AND 1985 AND FOLLOWED THROUGH 2011. WE USE THE TIMING OF THE PASSAGE OF COURT-MANDATED REFORMS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED TYPE OF FUNDING FORMULA CHANGE AS EXOGENOUS SHIFTERS OF SCHOOL SPENDING, AND WE COMPARE THE ADULT OUTCOMES OF COHORTS THAT WERE DIFFERENTIALLY EXPOSED TO SCHOOL FINANCE REFORMS, DEPENDING ON PLACE AND YEAR OF BIRTH. EVENT STUDY AND INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE MODELS REVEAL THAT A 10% INCREASE IN PER PUPIL SPENDING EACH YEAR FOR ALL 12 YEARS OF PUBLIC SCHOOL LEADS TO 0.31 MORE COMPLETED YEARS OF EDUCATION, ABOUT 7% HIGHER WAGES, AND A 3.2 PERCENTAGE POINT REDUCTION IN THE ANNUAL INCIDENCE OF ADULT POVERTY; EFFECTS ARE MUCH MORE PRONOUNCED FOR CHILDREN FROM LOW-INCOME FAMILIES. EXOGENOUS SPENDING INCREASES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH NOTABLE IMPROVEMENTS IN MEASURED SCHOOL INPUTS, INCLUDING REDUCTIONS IN STUDENT-TO-TEACHER RATIOS, INCREASES IN TEACHER SALARIES, AND LONGER SCHOOL YEARS.DOWNLOAD

WE DEVELOP AN INSTRUMENT FOR FUTURE CHANGES IN INCARCERATION RATES BASED ON THE THEORETICALLY PREDICTED DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT PATH OF THE AGGREGATE INCARCERATION RATE IN RESPONSE TO A SHOCK TO PRISON ENTRANCE OR EXIT TRANSITION PROBABILITIES. GIVEN THAT INCARCERATION RATES ADJUST TO PERMANENT CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR WITH A DYNAMIC LAG, ONE CAN IDENTIFY VARIATION IN INCARCERATION RATES THAT IS NOT CONTAMINATED BY CONTEMPORARY CHANGES IN CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. FOR THE PERIOD 1978-2004, WE FIND CRIME-PRISON ELASTICITIES THAT ARE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THOSE IMPLIED BY ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATES. WE ALSO PRESENT RESULTS FOR TWO SUB-PERIODS: 1978-90 AND 1991-2004. OUR INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES ESTIMATES FOR THE EARLIER PERIOD SUGGEST RELATIVELY LARGE CRIME-PRISON EFFECTS. FOR THE LATER TIME PERIOD, HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INCARCERATION RATES ON CRIME RATES ARE MUCH SMALLER.DOWNLOAD

JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ANALYSIS & POLICY: ADVANCES VOL. 11 : ISS. 3, ARTICLE 6.THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE EXTENT AND WAYS IN WHICH CHILDHOOD FAMILY AND NEIGHBORHOOD QUALITY INFLUENCE LATER-LIFE HEALTH OUTCOMES. THE STUDY ANALYZES THE HEALTH TRAJECTORIES OF CHILDREN BORN BETWEEN 1950 AND 1970 FOLLOWED THROUGH 2005. DATA FROM THE PANEL STUDY OF INCOME DYNAMICS (PSID) SPANNING FOUR DECADES ARE LINKED WITH INFORMATION ON NEIGHBORHOOD ATTRIBUTES AND SCHOOL QUALITY RESOURCES THAT PREVAILED AT THE TIME THESE CHILDREN WERE GROWING UP.THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY FINDINGS. FIRST, ESTIMATES OF SIBLING AND CHILD NEIGHBOR CORRELATIONS IN HEALTH ARE USED TO BOUND THE PROPORTION OF INEQUALITY IN HEALTH STATUS IN CHILDHOOD THROUGH MID-LIFE THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHILDHOOD FAMILY AND NEIGHBORHOOD QUALITY. ESTIMATES BASED ON FOUR-LEVEL HIERARCHICAL RANDOM EFFECTS MODELS (NEIGHBORHOODS, FAMILIES, INDIVIDUALS, OVER TIME) CONSISTENTLY SHOW A SIGNIFICANT SCOPE FOR BOTH CHILDHOOD FAMILY AND NEIGHBORHOOD BACKGROUND (INCLUDING SCHOOL QUALITY). THE RESULTS IMPLY SUBSTANTIAL PERSISTENCE IN HEALTH STATUS ACROSS GENERATIONS THAT ARE LINKED IN PART TO LOW INTERGENERATIONAL ECONOMIC MOBILITY. SIBLING CORRELATIONS ARE LARGE THROUGHOUT AT LEAST THE FIRST 50 YEARS OF LIFE: ROUGHLY THREE-FIFTHS OF ADULT HEALTH DISPARITIES MAY BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO FAMILY AND NEIGHBORHOOD BACKGROUND. CHILDHOOD NEIGHBOR CORRELATIONS IN ADULT HEALTH ARE ALSO SUBSTANTIAL (NET OF THE SIMILARITY ARISING FROM SIMILAR FAMILY CHARACTERISTICS), SUGGESTING THAT DISPARITIES IN NEIGHBORHOOD BACKGROUND ACCOUNT FOR MORE THAN ONE-THIRD OF THE VARIATION IN HEALTH STATUS IN MID LIFE.DOWNLOAD 
									PDF JOHNSON, RUCKER AND STEVEN RAPHAEL (2009) “THE EFFECT OF MALE INCARCERATION DYNAMICS ON AIDS INFECTION RATES AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMEN AND MEN,” JOURNAL OF LAW AND ECONOMICS, 52(2):251-293.IN THIS PAPER, WE INVESTIGATE THE POTENTIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN INCARCERATION DYNAMICS AND AIDS INFECTION RATES, WITH A PARTICULAR EMPHASIS ON THE BLACK-WHITE AIDS RATE DISPARITY. USING CASELEVEL DATA FROM THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, WE CONSTRUCT A PANEL DATA SET OF AIDS INFECTION RATES COVERING THE PERIOD 1982 TO 1996 THAT VARY BY YEAR OF ONSET, MODE OF TRANSMISSION, STATE OF RESIDENCE, AGE, GENDER, AND RACE/ETHNICITY. USING DATA FROM THE U.S. CENSUS, WE CONSTRUCT A CONFORMING PANEL OF MALE AND FEMALE INCARCERATION RATES. WE USE THIS PANEL DATA TO MODEL THE DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MALE AND FEMALE AIDS INFECTION RATES AND THE PROPORTION OF MEN IN THE AGE/STATE/RACE-MATCHED COHORT THAT ARE INCARCERATED. WE FIND VERY STRONG EFFECTS OF MALE INCARCERATION RATES ON BOTH MALE AND FEMALE AIDS INFECTION RATES. THE DYNAMIC STRUCTURE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP PARALLELS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INCUBATION TIME BETWEEN HIV INFECTION AND THE ONSET OF FULL-BLOWN AIDS DOCUMENTED IN THE MEDICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL LITERATURE. THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO EXPLICIT CONTROLS FOR (RACE-SPECIFIC) YEAR FIXED EFFECTS AND A FULLY INTERACTED SET OF AGE/RACE/STATE FIXED EFFECTS. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE HIGHER INCARCERATION RATES AMONG BLACK MALES OVER THIS PERIOD EXPLAIN THE LION’S SHARE OF THE RACIAL DISPARITY IN AIDS INFECTION BETWEEN BLACK WOMEN AND WOMEN OF OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. THE MAGNITUDE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE EFFECTS PERSIST AFTER CONTROLLING FOR MEASURES OF CRACK COCAINE PREVALENCE AND FLOW RATES IN AND OUT OF PRISON. IN A SEPARATE ANALYSIS, WE EXPLOIT THE OCCURRENCE OF SYSTEM-WIDE STATE PRISON OVERCROWDING LITIGATION AS AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE FOR THE FLOW RATE OF PRISON RELEASES. WE FIND SHORT-RUN INCREASES IN PRISON RELEASE RATES THAT WERE INDUCED BY FINAL COURT DECISIONS ON RELIEF OF PRISONER OVERCROWDING RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SUBSEQUENT AIDS INFECTION RATES AMONG WOMEN AND BLACKS, MANIFESTING 5-10 YEARS FOLLOWING THE INCREASE OF PRISON RELEASES.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (MAY 2023)AT THE TURN OF THE 20TH CENTURY, MOST CITIES IN AMERICA FEATURED A PATRONAGE-BASED SYSTEM OF GOVERNANCE, BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW DECADES, PATRONAGE WAS REPLACED BY CIVIL SERVICE. CIVIL SERVICE RESTRUCTURED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ELECTED OFFICIALS AND GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES, WITH EMPLOYEES BENEFITING FROM A VARIETY OF NEW PROTECTIONS.  YET IN STUDYING THIS CHANGE, SCHOLARS HAVE LARGELY IGNORED THE ROLE LOCAL EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES MIGHT HAVE PLAYED IN THE TRANSFORMATION.  WE ARGUE THAT CITY EMPLOYEES STOOD TO BENEFIT FROM CIVIL SERVICE, AND IN PLACES WHERE THEY HAD AGENCY AND CLOUT, THEY WERE IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF ITS ADOPTION.  WE COLLECTED A DATASET FOR MORE THAN 1,000 MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS, DETERMINING WHETHER AND WHEN THEY ADOPTED CIVIL SERVICE AND WHETHER THEIR EMPLOYEES WERE ORGANIZED IN AN OCCUPATIONAL ORGANIZATION.  OUR ANALYSIS OF THESE NEW DATA SHOWS THE INFLUENCE OF CITY EMPLOYEES WAS AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTOR TO THE SPREAD OF CIVIL SERVICE IN AMERICAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT.DOWNLOAD

EVIDENCE FROM AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS.” AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW.WHEN INDIVIDUALS RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS, DOES IT AFFECT THEIR ATTITUDES TOWARD THOSE PROGRAMS, OR TOWARD GOVERNMENT GENERALLY? A GROWING LITERATURE BLENDS POLICY FEEDBACK THEORY AND POLITICAL BEHAVIOR RESEARCH TO EXPLORE THESE QUESTIONS, BUT SO FAR IT HAS FOCUSED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ON SOCIAL POLICIES SUCH AS THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE FOCUS ON A VERY DIFFERENT SET OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS THAT REACH A MORE CONSERVATIVE, RURAL POPULATION: AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANCE.  OUR STUDY TIES ADMINISTRATIVE RECORDS ON PARTICIPATION IN USDA FARM AID PROGRAMS TO AN ORIGINAL, FIRST-OF-ITS-KIND SURVEY MEASURING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCERS’ POLITICAL ATTITUDES. WE FIND THAT RECEIVING AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANCE IS SOMETIMES RELATED TO PRODUCERS’ VIEWS OF THE PROGRAM DELIVERING THE BENEFITS, BUT IT DEPENDS ON THE DIVISIVENESS OF THE PROGRAM AND—FOR HIGHLY PARTISAN PROGRAMS—RECIPIENTS’ IDEOLOGY. HOWEVER, RECEIVING FEDERAL AGRICULTURAL ASSISTANCE IS NOT ASSOCIATED WITH MORE POSITIVE VIEWS OF GOVERNMENT.ANZIA, SARAH F., AND RACHEL BERNHARD. FORTHCOMING. “HOW DOES GENDER STEREOTYPING AFFECT WOMEN CANDIDATES? NEW EVIDENCE FROM LOCAL ELECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA.” BRITISH JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE.RESEARCH SHOWS THAT VOTERS OFTEN USE GENDER STEREOTYPES TO EVALUATE CANDIDATES, WHICH SHOULD HELP WOMEN IN SOME ELECTORAL CONTEXTS AND HURT THEM IN OTHERS. YET MOST RESEARCH EXAMINES A SINGLE CONTEXT AT A TIME—USUALLY U.S. NATIONAL ELECTIONS, WHERE PARTISANSHIP IS STRONG—AND EMPLOYS SURVEYS AND EXPERIMENTS, RAISING CONCERNS THAT CITIZENS’ RESPONSES MAY NOT REFLECT HOW THEY ACTUALLY VOTE. BY ANALYZING RETURNS FROM THOUSANDS OF NONPARTISAN LOCAL ELECTIONS, WE TEST WHETHER PATTERNS OF WOMEN’S WIN RATES RELATIVE TO MEN’S MATCH EXPECTATIONS FOR HOW THE ELECTORAL EFFECTS OF GENDER STEREOTYPING SHOULD VARY BY CONTEXT. WE FIND WOMEN HAVE GREATER ADVANTAGES OVER MEN IN CITY COUNCIL THAN MAYORAL RACES, STILL GREATER ADVANTAGES IN SCHOOL BOARD RACES, AND DECREASING ADVANTAGES IN MORE CONSERVATIVE CONSTITUENCIES. THUS, WOMEN FARE BETTER IN STEREOTYPE-CONGRUENT CONTEXTS AND WORSE IN INCONGRUENT CONTEXTS. THESE EFFECTS ARE MOST PRONOUNCED DURING ON-CYCLE ELECTIONS, WHEN VOTERS TEND TO KNOW LESS ABOUT LOCAL CANDIDATES.ANZIA. SARAH F. 2021. “PARTY AND IDEOLOGY IN AMERICAN LOCAL GOVERNMENT: AN APPRAISAL.” ANNUAL REVIEW OF POLITICAL SCIENCE 24: 133-150.FOR DECADES, RESEARCH ON U.S. LOCAL POLITICS EMPHASIZED THE DISTINCTIVENESS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT, BUT THAT HAS BEGUN TO CHANGE. IN RECENT YEARS, NEW DATA ON PARTISANSHIP AND IDEOLOGY HAVE TRANSFORMED THE STUDY OF LOCAL POLITICS. MUCH OF THE ENSUING SCHOLARSHIP HAS CONCLUDED THAT LOCAL POLITICS RESEMBLES POLITICS IN STATE AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS: PARTISAN AND IDEOLOGICAL. I ARGUE THAT SUCH A CONCLUSION IS PREMATURE. SO FAR, THIS NEWER LITERATURE HAS BEEN INSUFFICIENTLY ATTENTIVE TO THE POLICIES U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS MAKE—AND THAT THEY ARE MOSTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ISSUES THAT DOMINATE NATIONAL POLITICS. GOING FORWARD, SCHOLARS SHOULD PRIORITIZE MEASUREMENT OF PREFERENCES ON THESE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES. THEY SHOULD DEVELOP THEORIES OF WHEN AND WHY LOCAL POLITICAL DIVISIONS WILL MIRROR NATIONAL PARTISANSHIP AND IDEOLOGY. AND THEY SHOULD INVESTIGATE WHY THERE ARE LINKS BETWEEN SOME LOCAL POLICIES AND NATIONAL PARTISANSHIP AND IDEOLOGY—AND WHETHER THOSE LINKS ALSO EXIST FOR CORE LOCAL GOVERNMENT ISSUES.ANZIA, SARAH F. FORTHCOMING. “PENSIONS IN THE TRENCHES:  HOW PENSION SPENDING IS AFFECTING U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENT.” URBAN AFFAIRS REVIEW.SOME EXPERTS CLAIM THAT U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE EXPERIENCING DRAMATIC INCREASES IN PENSION EXPENDITURES AND THAT PENSION SPENDING IS CROWDING OUT GOVERNMENT SERVICES. OTHERS MAINTAIN THAT SERIOUS PENSION PROBLEMS ARE LIMITED. THIS ISSUE IS IMPORTANT TO POLITICAL SCIENTISTS, URBAN SCHOLARS, AND POLICY PRACTITIONERS, BUT NO EXISTING STUDIES—NOR THE DATASETS THEY RELY ON— ALLOW EVALUATION OF WHETHER PENSION EXPENDITURES ARE RISING OR HOW THEY ARE AFFECTING LOCAL GOVERNMENT. THIS ARTICLE ANALYZES A NEW DATASET OF THE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENDITURES OF OVER 400 MUNICIPALITIES AND COUNTIES FROM 2005 TO 2016. I FIND THAT PENSION EXPENDITURES ROSE ALMOST EVERYWHERE OVER THIS PERIOD, BUT THERE IS SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN THAT GROWTH. ON AVERAGE, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE NOT RESPONDING TO RISING PENSION SPENDING BY INCREASING REVENUE. THEY ARE INSTEAD SHRINKING THEIR WORKFORCES. MOREOVER, I FIND THAT THE MAGNITUDE OF THE EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS DUE TO PENSIONS VARIES WITH KEY FEATURES OF THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT.ANZIA, SARAH F., AND TERRY M. MOE. 2019. “INTEREST GROUPS ON THE INSIDE: THE GOVERNANCE OF PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS.” PERSPECTIVES ON POLITICS 17(4): 1059-1078NEW SCHOLARSHIP IN AMERICAN POLITICS ARGUES THAT INTEREST GROUPS SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK TO THE CENTER OF THE FIELD. WE ATTEMPT TO FURTHER THAT AGENDA BY EXPLORING AN ASPECT OF GROUP INFLUENCE THAT HAS BEEN LITTLE STUDIED: THE ROLE INTEREST GROUPS PLAY ON THE INSIDE OF GOVERNMENT AS OFFICIAL PARTICIPANTS IN BUREAUCRATIC DECISION-MAKING. THE CHALLENGES FOR RESEARCH ARE FORMIDABLE, BUT A FULLER UNDERSTANDING OF GROUP INFLUENCE IN AMERICAN POLITICS REQUIRES THAT THEY BE TAKEN ON. HERE WE CARRY OUT AN EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS THAT FOCUSES ON THE BUREAUCRATIC BOARDS THAT GOVERN PUBLIC PENSIONS. THESE ARE GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES OF ENORMOUS FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCE FOR STATE GOVERNMENTS, PUBLIC WORKERS, AND TAXPAYERS. THEY ALSO MAKE DECISIONS THAT ARE QUANTITATIVE (AND COMPARABLE) IN NATURE, AND THEY USUALLY GRANT OFFICIAL POLICYMAKING AUTHORITY TO A KEY INTEREST GROUP: PUBLIC EMPLOYEES AND THEIR UNIONS. OUR ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT “INTEREST GROUPS ON THE INSIDE” DO HAVE INFLUENCE—IN WAYS THAT WEAKEN EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT. GOING FORWARD, SCHOLARS SHOULD DEVOTE GREATER ATTENTION TO HOW INSIDER ROLES VARY ACROSS AGENCIES AND GROUPS, HOW GROUPS EXERCISE INFLUENCE IN THESE WAYS, HOW DIFFERENT GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES SHAPE THEIR POLICY EFFECTS, AND WHAT IT ALL MEANS FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF INTEREST GROUPS IN AMERICAN POLITICS.ANZIA, SARAH F. 2019. “LOOKING FOR INFLUENCE IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES: HOW STUDYING SUBNATIONAL POLICY CAN REVIVE RESEARCH ON INTEREST GROUPS.” JOURNAL OF POLITICS 81(1): 343-351.THE AMERICAN POLITICS LITERATURE ON REPRESENTATION FOCUSES ON VOTERS AND ELECTED OFFICIALS, BUT A GROWING GROUP OF POLITICAL SCIENTISTS ARE ARGUING THAT MORE SHOULD BE DONE TO STUDY INTEREST GROUPS. YET THERE ALREADY IS A LARGE LITERATURE ON INTEREST GROUPS, AND IT HAS STRUGGLED TO SHOW EVIDENCE OF INTEREST GROUP INFLUENCE. I ARGUE HERE THAT THE INTEREST GROUP LITERATURE’S NEAR-EXCLUSIVE FOCUS ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HINDERED ITS PROGRESS: BASIC QUESTIONS HAVE GONE UNASKED, IMPORTANT INTEREST GROUPS HAVE GONE UNDERAPPRECIATED, AND THE AMOUNT OF INFLUENCE HAS BEEN UNDERESTIMATED. BY STUDYING US SUBNATIONAL POLICYMAKING, SCHOLARS WOULD DISCOVER DIFFERENT CONSTELLATIONS OF INTEREST GROUPS, AND THEY WOULD FIND THAT THE VARIATION IN SUBNATIONAL GOVERNMENTS ALLOWS FOR EMPIRICAL DESIGNS THAT ARE BETTER ABLE TO DETECT INTEREST GROUP INFLUENCE WHEN IT EXISTS. THE PAYOFFS OF A SUBNATIONAL FOCUS WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL—BOTH FOR OUR UNDERSTANDING OF INTEREST GROUPS AND FOR THE STUDY OF POLITICAL REPRESENTATION.ANZIA, SARAH F. 2019. “WHEN DOES A GROUP OF CITIZENS INFLUENCE POLICY?  EVIDENCE FROM SENIOR CITIZEN PARTICIPATION IN CITY POLITICS.” JOURNAL OF POLITICS 81(1): 1-14.WHEN DOES A GROUP OF CITIZENS INFLUENCE PUBLIC POLICY?  MAINSTREAM AMERICAN POLITICS RESEARCH EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THE GROUP’S TURNOUT AND PRESENCE IN THE ELECTORATE, BUT THERE HAVE BEEN FEW EMPIRICAL TESTS OF THOSE HYPOTHESES.  MEANWHILE, OTHER SCHOLARS ARGUE THAT GROUP COHESIVENESS, ORGANIZATION, AND NON-VOTING POLITICAL ACTIVITY ARE POTENTIALLY MORE IMPORTANT THAN VOTING FOR SHAPING POLICY.  THESE TWO STRANDS OF THE LITERATURE HAVE LARGELY DEVELOPED IN PARALLEL, HOWEVER, IN PART BECAUSE THEY TEND TO EMPLOY DIFFERENT EMPIRICAL METHODS.  IN THIS PAPER, I ATTEMPT TO BRIDGE THE DIVIDE BETWEEN THEM AND TEST THESE IDEAS WITHIN THE SAME EMPIRICAL FRAMEWORK, USING SENIOR CITIZENS AND SENIOR-FRIENDLY TRANSPORTATION POLICY AS A TEST CASE.  MY RESULTS SHOW THAT SENIOR VOTING DOES NOT UNCONDITIONALLY PREDICT POLICIES FRIENDLIER TO SENIORS.  INSTEAD, I FIND THAT CITY POLICIES ARE FRIENDLIER TO SENIORS WHEN SENIORS ARE A MORE COHESIVE, MEANINGFUL GROUP, AND WHEN THEY ENGAGE IN ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN VOTING.ANZIA, SARAH F., AND TERRY M. MOE. 2017. “POLARIZATION AND POLICY:  THE POLITICS OF PUBLIC-SECTOR PENSIONS.” LEGISLATIVE STUDIES QUARTERLY 42 (1): 33-62.FOR DECADES, AMERICA’S STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE PROMISED THEIR WORKERS INCREASINGLY GENEROUS PENSIONS BUT FAILED TO FULLY FUND THEM, PRODUCING A FISCAL PROBLEM OF STAGGERING PROPORTIONS. IN THIS PAPER, WE EXAMINE THE POLITICS OF PUBLIC PENSIONS. WHILE MAINSTREAM THEORETICAL IDEAS IN THE AMERICAN POLITICS LITERATURE WOULD SUGGEST THE PENSION ISSUE SHOULD BE POLARIZED, WITH DEMOCRATS PUSHING FOR GENEROUS PENSIONS OVER REPUBLICAN RESISTANCE, WE DEVELOP AN ARGUMENT—ROOTED IN MORE TRADITIONAL THEORETICAL WORK BY SCHATTSCHNEIDER, LOWI, WILSON, AND OTHERS—IMPLYING THAT BOTH PARTIES SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO SUPPORT GENEROUS PENSIONS DURING NORMAL TIMES, AND THAT ONLY AFTER THE ONSET OF THE GREAT RECESSION, WHICH EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF CONFLICT, SHOULD THE PARTIES BEGIN TO DIVERGE. USING A NEW DATASET OF STATE LEGISLATORS’ VOTES ON HUNDREDS OF PENSION BILLS PASSED BETWEEN 1999 AND 2011, WE CARRY OUT AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS THAT SUPPORTS THESE EXPECTATIONS.ANZIA, SARAH F., AND TERRY M.

YET IF POLICIES DO INDEED MAKE POLITICS, RATIONAL POLITICIANS HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE POLICIES TO STRUCTURE FUTURE POLITICS TO THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE—AND THIS STRATEGIC DIMENSION HAS GONE ALMOST ENTIRELY UNEXPLORED.  DO POLITICIANS ACTUALLY USE POLICIES TO MAKE POLITICS?  UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS?  IN THIS PAPER, WE DEVELOP A THEORETICAL ARGUMENT ABOUT WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED FROM STRATEGIC POLITICIANS, AND WE CARRY OUT AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS ON A POLICY DEVELOPMENT THAT IS PARTICULARLY INSTRUCTIVE: THE ADOPTION OF PUBLIC-SECTOR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LAWS BY THE STATES DURING THE 1960S, 1970S, AND EARLY 1980S—LAWS THAT FUELED THE RISE OF PUBLIC-SECTOR UNIONS, AND “MADE POLITICS” TO THE ADVANTAGE OF DEMOCRATS OVER REPUBLICANS.  ANZIA, SARAH F. 2014.

HERE WE EXPLORE THE EFFECTS OF PUBLIC SECTOR UNIONS ON THE COSTS OF GOVERNMENT. WE PRESENT TWO SEPARATE STUDIES, USING DIFFERENT DATASETS FROM DIFFERENT HISTORICAL PERIODS, AND WE EXAMINE SEVERAL OUTCOMES: SALARIES, HEALTH BENEFITS, AND EMPLOYMENT. WE FIND THAT UNIONS AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING INCREASE THE COSTS OF GOVERNMENT, AND THAT THE EFFECTS ARE SUBSTANTIVELY SIGNIFICANT. WE VIEW THIS ANALYSIS AS AN OPENING WEDGE THAT WE HOPE WILL ENCOURAGE A MORE EXTENSIVE LINE OF NEW RESEARCH—AND NEW THINKING ABOUT AMERICAN INTEREST GROUPS.

	COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IS COMMON IN AMERICAN PUBLIC EDUCATION, BUT ITS CONSEQUENCES ARE POORLY UNDERSTOOD. WE FOCUS HERE ON KEY CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS—SENIORITY-BASED TRANSFER RIGHTS—THAT AFFECT TEACHER ASSIGNMENTS, AND WE SHOW THAT THESE TRANSFER RIGHTS OPERATE TO BURDEN DISADVANTAGED SCHOOLS WITH HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF INEXPERIENCED TEACHERS. WE ALSO SHOW THAT THIS IMPACT IS CONDITIONAL: IT IS SUBSTANTIAL IN LARGE DISTRICTS, WHERE DECISIONS ARE LIKELY TO FOLLOW RULES, BUT IT IS VIRTUALLY ZERO IN SMALL DISTRICTS, WHERE DECISIONS TEND TO BE LESS FORMAL AND UNDESIRABLE OUTCOMES CAN MORE EASILY BE AVOIDED. THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES ARE THUS CONCENTRATED ON PRECISELY THOSE DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS—LARGE DISTRICTS, HIGH-MINORITY SCHOOLS—THAT HAVE BEEN THE NATION’S WORST PERFORMERS AND THE MOST DIFFICULT TO IMPROVE.ANZIA, SARAH F., AND TERRY M.

	A VAST LITERATURE ARGUES THAT THE MAJORITY PARTY IN MOST LEGISLATURES ENJOYS A POLICYMAKING ADVANTAGE THROUGH ITS ACCESS TO GATEKEEPING INSTITUTIONS THAT LET IT BLOCK BILLS FROM REACHING THE FLOOR. HOWEVER, AGENDA-SETTING INSTITUTIONS VARY SUBSTANTIALLY ACROSS LEGISLATURES. WE PROPOSE THAT THIS VARIATION SHOULD HAVE DEMONSTRABLE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE MAJORITY PARTY’S INFLUENCE. IN THIS ARTICLE, WE DEVELOP HYPOTHESES ABOUT THE INSTITUTIONAL FEATURES OF LEGISLATURES THAT ENABLE THE MAJORITY PARTY TO BLOCK BILLS. THEN, WE CANVASS ALL 99 U.S. STATE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS TO MEASURE WHETHER THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE PRESENT AND TEST WHETHER THEY LOWER THE RATE AT WHICH THE MAJORITY PARTY IS ROLLED. WE FIND THAT IN LEGISLATURES WHERE MAJORITY-APPOINTED COMMITTEES CAN DECLINE TO HEAR BILLS OR DECLINE TO REPORT THEM TO THE FLOOR, OR WHERE THE MAJORITY LEADERSHIP CAN BLOCK BILLS FROM APPEARING ON THE CALENDAR, MAJORITY ROLL RATES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN IN LEGISLATURES WHERE THOSE VETO POINTS ARE ABSENT.DOWNLOAD

ANZIA, SARAH F. 2012. ""THE ELECTION TIMING EFFECT: EVIDENCE FROM A POLICY INTERVENTION IN TEXAS."" QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF POLITICAL SCIENCE. 7 (3): 209-248.
	MANY GOVERNMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES HOLD ELECTIONS ON DAYS OTHER THAN NATIONAL ELECTION DAY. RECENT STUDIES HAVE ARGUED THAT THE LOW VOTER TURNOUT THAT ACCOMPANIES SUCH OFF-CYCLE ELECTIONS COULD CREATE AN ADVANTAGE FOR INTEREST GROUPS. HOWEVER, THE ENDOGENEITY OF ELECTION TIMING MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE ITS CAUSAL EFFECT ON POLITICAL OUTCOMES. IN THIS PAPER, I DEVELOP A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THAT EXPLAINS HOW CHANGES TO ELECTION TIMING AFFECT THE ELECTORAL FORTUNES OF ORGANIZED INTEREST GROUPS. I TEST THE THEORY BY EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF A 2006 TEXAS LAW THAT FORCED APPROXIMATELY 20 PERCENT OF THE STATE’S SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO MOVE THEIR ELECTIONS TO THE SAME DAY AS NATIONAL ELECTIONS. USING MATCHING AS WELL AS DISTRICT FIXED EFFECTS REGRESSION, I ESTIMATE THE CAUSAL EFFECT OF THE SWITCH TO ON-CYCLE ELECTION TIMING ON DISTRICT TEACHER SALARIES, SINCE TEACHERS AND THEIR UNIONS TEND TO BE THE DOMINANT INTEREST GROUP IN SCHOOL BOARD ELECTIONS. I FIND THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WERE FORCED TO SWITCH TO ON-CYCLE ELECTIONS RESPONDED BY GRANTING SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SALARY RAISES TO TEACHERS, SUPPORTING THE HYPOTHESIS THAT SCHOOL TRUSTEES WERE LESS RESPONSIVE TO THE DOMINANT INTEREST GROUP AFTER THE SWITCH.

	EIGHTY PERCENT OF AMERICAN CITIES TODAY HOLD THEIR GENERAL ELECTIONS ON DIFFERENT DAYS THAN STATE AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS. IT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT VOTER TURNOUT IN THESE OFF-CYCLE LOCAL ELECTIONS IS FAR LOWER THAN TURNOUT IN LOCAL ELECTIONS HELD CONCURRENTLY WITH STATE AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS. IN THIS PAPER, I DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TIMING OF CITY ELECTIONS HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT DETERMINANT OF VOTER TURNOUT SINCE BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR. BY EXAMINING THREE LARGE AMERICAN CITIES OVER THE COURSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY, I FIND THAT AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES REGULARLY MANIPULATED THE TIMING OF CITY ELECTIONS TO SECURE AN EDGE OVER THEIR RIVALS. I SHOW THAT THE DECISIONS TO CHANGE THE ELECTION DATES OF THESE CITIES WERE CONTENTIOUS, PARTISAN, AND MOTIVATED BY AN EXPECTATION OF SUBSEQUENT ELECTORAL GAIN. THE PROGRESSIVE MUNICIPAL REFORMERS OF THE LATE NINETEENTH AND EARLY TWENTIETH CENTURIES CONTINUED IN THIS TRADITION WHEN THEY SEPARATED CITY ELECTIONS FROM STATE AND NATIONAL ELECTIONS, AND THE LOCAL ELECTION SCHEDULE THEY IMPLEMENTED HAS LARGELY PERSISTED UNTIL TODAY.

	IF VOTERS ARE BIASED AGAINST FEMALE CANDIDATES, ONLY THE MOST TALENTED, HARDEST WORKING FEMALE CANDIDATES WILL SUCCEED IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS. FURTHERMORE, IF WOMEN PERCEIVE THERE TO BE SEX DISCRIMINATION IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS, OR IF THEY UNDERESTIMATE THEIR QUALIFICATIONS FOR OFFICE, THEN ONLY THE MOST QUALIFIED, POLITICALLY AMBITIOUS FEMALES WILL EMERGE AS CANDIDATES. WE ARGUE THAT WHEN EITHER OR BOTH FORMS OF SEX-BASED SELECTION ARE PRESENT, THE WOMEN WHO ARE ELECTED TO OFFICE WILL PERFORM BETTER, ON AVERAGE, THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS. WE TEST THIS CENTRAL IMPLICATION OF OUR THEORY BY STUDYING THE RELATIVE SUCCESS OF MEN AND WOMEN IN DELIVERING FEDERAL SPENDING TO THEIR DISTRICTS AND IN SPONSORING LEGISLATION. ANALYZING CHANGES WITHIN DISTRICTS OVER TIME, WE FIND THAT CONGRESSWOMEN SECURE ROUGHLY 9% MORE SPENDING FROM FEDERAL DISCRETIONARY PROGRAMS THAN CONGRESSMEN. WOMEN ALSO SPONSOR AND COSPONSOR SIGNIFICANTLY MORE BILLS THAN THEIR MALE COLLEAGUES.
ANZIA, SARAH F. 2011. ""ELECTION TIMING AND THE ELECTORAL INFLUENCE OF INTEREST GROUPS."" JOURNAL OF POLITICS 73 (2): 412-427.
	IT IS AN ESTABLISHED FACT THAT OFF-CYCLE ELECTIONS ATTRACT LOWER VOTER TURNOUT THAN ON-CYCLE ELECTIONS. I ARGUE THAT THE DECREASE IN TURNOUT THAT ACCOMPANIES OFF-CYCLE ELECTION TIMING CREATES A STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ORGANIZED INTEREST GROUPS. MEMBERS OF INTEREST GROUPS WITH A LARGE STAKE IN AN ELECTION OUTCOME TURN OUT AT HIGH RATES REGARDLESS OF ELECTION TIMING, AND THEIR EFFORTS TO MOBILIZE AND PERSUADE VOTERS HAVE A GREATER IMPACT WHEN TURNOUT IS LOW. CONSEQUENTLY, POLICY MADE BY OFFICIALS ELECTED IN OFF-CYCLE ELECTIONS SHOULD BE MORE FAVORABLE TO THE DOMINANT INTEREST GROUP IN A POLITY THAN POLICY MADE BY OFFICIALS ELECTED IN ON-CYCLE ELECTIONS. I TEST THIS THEORY USING DATA ON SCHOOL DISTRICT ELECTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, IN WHICH TEACHER UNIONS ARE THE DOMINANT INTEREST GROUP. I FIND THAT DISTRICTS WITH OFF-CYCLE ELECTIONS PAY EXPERIENCED TEACHERS OVER 3% MORE THAN DISTRICTS THAT HOLD ON-CYCLE ELECTIONS.DOWNLOAD

FOR THIS RESEARCH PROJECT, I GATHERED THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORTS OF ROUGHLY 800 LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM 2005 TO 2016, INCLUDING MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS, COUNTIES, SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. I USED INFORMATION IN THE REPORTS TO DOCUMENT HOW MUCH EACH LOCAL GOVERNMENT SPENT ON ITS EMPLOYEES’ PENSIONS EACH YEAR. THIS DATASET ALLOWS US TO SEE WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE ACTUALLY SPENDING ON THEIR EMPLOYEES' PENSIONS AND HOW THAT HAS CHANGED OVER TIME--NOT JUST IN THE PLACES WITH THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS, BUT IN A LARGE, DIVERSE SET OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. I HAVE ALSO COMPILED ANNUAL DATA ON LOCAL FINANCES AND EMPLOYMENT FROM THE U.S. CENSUS BUREAU’S SURVEY OF GOVERNMENTS (SOG) FOR THE SAME YEARS.PLEASE NOTE THE FOLLOWING: THESE DATA ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT PENSION COSTS TRACK WHAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ACTUALLY SPENT ON PENSIONS FROM 2005 TO 2016, NOT WHAT THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPENDING. THEY ALSO DO NOT TRACK THE FUNDING RATIOS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS' PENSION PLANS. A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA COLLECTION IS AVAILABLE HERE. THE DATA PRODUCED FROM THIS PROJECT ARE AVAILABLE BELOW. THEY INCLUDE (1) THE DATABASE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT CAFRS, (2) DATASETS AT THE LEVEL OF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT, PENSION PLAN, AND YEAR--ONE EACH FOR MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS, COUNTIES, SCHOOL DISTRICTS, AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS, AND (3) CITY AND COUNTY DATA AGGREGATED BY LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND YEAR, COMPLETE WITH CORRESPONDING SOG DATA ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT EMPLOYMENT AND FINANCES, CITY AND COUNTY DEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES, AND MORE. THIS THIRD DATASET IS USED FOR THE ANALYSIS IN MY WORKING PAPER, ""PENSIONS IN THE TRENCHES: HOW PENSION COSTS ARE AFFECTING U.S. LOCAL GOVERNMENT.""PLEASE CITE THE FOLLOWING WHEN USING THESE DATA:  ANZIA, SARAH F. 2019.

					WORKING PAPER (JULY 2019)WE DEVELOP EMPIRICALLY-GROUNDED ESTIMATES OF WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY TO AVOID EXCESS MORTALITY RISKS CAUSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE. USING 40 COUNTRIES' SUBNATIONAL DATA, WE ESTIMATE A MORTALITY-TEMPERATURE RELATIONSHIP THAT ENABLES GLOBAL EXTRAPOLATION TO COUNTRIES WITHOUT DATA AND PROJECTION OF ITS FUTURE EVOLUTION, ACCOUNTING FOR ADAPTATION BENEFITS. FURTHER, WE DEVELOP A REVEALED PREFERENCE APPROACH TO RECOVER UNOBSERVED ADAPTATION COSTS. WE COMBINE THESE COMPONENTS WITH 33 HIGH-RESOLUTION CLIMATE SIMULATIONS, WHICH PRODUCES A RIGHT-SKEWED DISTRIBUTION OF GLOBAL WTP WITH A MEAN OF $38.1 PER TCO2 UNDER A HIGH EMISSIONS SCENARIO. PROJECTIONS GENERALLY INDICATE INCREASED MORTALITY IN TODAY'S POOR LOCATIONS AND HIGHER ADAPTATION EXPENDITURES IN RICH ONES.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (JUNE 2019)WE DEVELOP A SIMPLE CROSS-SECTIONAL RESEARCH DESIGN TO IDENTIFY CAUSAL EFFECTS THAT IS ROBUST TO UNOBSERVABLE HETEROGENEITY. WHEN MANY OBSERVATIONAL UNITS ARE DENSE IN PHYSICAL SPACE, IT MAY BE SUFFICIENT TO REGRESS THE “SPATIAL FIRST DIFFERENCES” (SFD) OF THE OUTCOME ON THE TREATMENT AND OMIT ALL COVARIATES. THIS APPROACH IS CONCEPTUALLY SIMILAR TO FIRST DIFFERENCING APPROACHES IN TIMESERIES OR PANEL MODELS, EXCEPT THE INDEX FOR TIME IS REPLACED WITH AN INDEX FOR LOCATIONS IN SPACE. THE SFD DESIGN IDENTIFIES PLAUSIBLY CAUSAL EFFECTS, EVEN WHEN NO INSTRUMENTS ARE AVAILABLE, SO LONG AS LOCAL CHANGES IN THE TREATMENT AND UNOBSERVABLE CONFOUNDERS ARE NOT SYSTEMATICALLY CORRELATED BETWEEN IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT NEIGHBORS. WE DEMONSTRATE THE SFD APPROACH BY RECOVERING NEW CROSS-SECTIONAL ESTIMATES FOR THE EFFECTS OF TIME-INVARIANT GEOGRAPHIC FACTORS, SOIL AND CLIMATE, ON LONG-RUN AVERAGE CROP PRODUCTIVITIES ACROSS US COUNTIES — RELATIONSHIPS THAT ARE NOTORIOUSLY CONFOUNDED BY UNOBSERVABLES BUT CRUCIAL FOR GUIDING ECONOMIC DECISIONS, SUCH AS LAND MANAGEMENT AND CLIMATE POLICY.DOWNLOAD

WE SYSTEMATICALLY EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THERMAL STRESS ON MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS OF ECONOMIC DECISIONMAKING, JUDGMENT, AND DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOR WITH 2,000 PARTICIPANTS IN KENYA AND THE US WHO WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES IN A LABORATORY. WE FIND THAT MOST DIMENSIONS OF DECISION-MAKING ARE UNAFFECTED BY TEMPERATURE.

					WORKING PAPER (JANUARY 2019)THIS PAPER SHOWS THAT GREATER GLOBAL SPATIAL CORRELATION OF PRODUCTIVITIES CAN INCREASE CROSSCOUNTRY WELFARE DISPERSION BY INCREASING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN A COUNTRY’S PRODUCTIVITY AND ITS GAINS FROM TRADE. WE CAUSALLY VALIDATE THIS GENERAL-EQUILIBRIUM PREDICTION USING A GLOBAL CLIMATIC PHENOMENON AS A NATURAL EXPERIMENT. WE FIND THAT GAINS FROM TRADE IN CEREALS OVER THE LAST HALFCENTURY WERE LARGER FOR MORE PRODUCTIVE COUNTRIES AND SMALLER FOR LESS PRODUCTIVE COUNTRIES WHEN CEREAL PRODUCTIVITY WAS MORE SPATIALLY CORRELATED. INCORPORATING THIS GENERAL-EQUILIBRIUM EFFECT INTO A PROJECTION OF CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS RAISES PROJECTED INTERNATIONAL INEQUALITY, WITH HIGHER WELFARE LOSSES ACROSS MOST OF AFRICA.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (NOVEMBER 2017)WE DEVELOP AN EMPIRICAL APPROACH TO VALUE CHANGES TO A CLIMATE IN TERMS OF TOTAL MARKET OUTPUT GIVEN OPTIMAL FACTOR ALLOCATIONS IN GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM. OUR APPROACH ACCOUNTS FOR UNOBSERVABLE HETEROGENEITY ACROSS LOCATIONS AS WELL AS THE COSTS AND BENEFITS OF ADAPTATION IN CLIMATES OF ARBITRARY DIMENSION. IMPORTANTLY, WE DEMONSTRATE THAT THE ENVELOPE THEOREM IMPLIES THE MARGINAL PRODUCT OF A LONG-RUN CLIMATE CAN BE EXACTLY IDENTIFIED USING ONLY IDIOSYNCRATIC WEATHER VARIATION. WE APPLY THIS METHOD TO THE TEMPERATURE CLIMATE OF THE MODERN UNITED STATES AND FIND THAT, DESPITE EVIDENCE THAT POPULATIONS ADAPT, THE MARGINAL PRODUCT OF TEMPERATURE HAS REMAINED UNCHANGED DURING 1970-2010, WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES HAVING LOW NET VALUE. INTEGRATING MARGINAL PRODUCTS RECOVERS A VALUE FUNCTION FOR TEMPERATURE, DESCRIBING THE CAUSAL EFFECT OF NON-MARGINAL CLIMATE CHANGES NET OF ADAPTIVE RE-OPTIMIZATION. WE USE THIS VALUE FUNCTION TO CONSIDER THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE IN THE CURRENT CROSS-SECTION AND A FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE SCENARIO.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (JUNE 2016)BLACK MARKETS ARE ESTIMATED TO REPRESENT A FIFTH OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, BUT THEIR RESPONSE TO POLICY IS POORLY UNDERSTOOD BECAUSE PARTICIPANTS SYSTEMATICALLY HIDE THEIR ACTIONS. IT IS WIDELY HYPOTHESIZED THAT RELAXING TRADE BANS IN ILLEGAL GOODS ALLOWS LEGAL SUPPLIES TO COMPETITIVELY DISPLACE ILLEGAL SUPPLIES, BUT A RICHER ECONOMIC THEORY PROVIDES MORE AMBIGUOUS PREDICTIONS. HERE WE EVALUATE THE FIRST MAJOR GLOBAL LEGALIZATION EXPERIMENT IN AN INTERNATIONALLY BANNED MARKET, WHERE A MONITORING SYSTEM ESTABLISHED BEFORE THE EXPERIMENT ENABLES US TO OBSERVE THE BEHAVIOR OF ILLEGAL SUPPLIERS BEFORE AND AFTER. INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF IVORY WAS BANNED IN 1989, WITH GLOBAL ELEPHANT POACHING DATA COLLECTED BY FIELD RESEARCHERS SINCE 2003. A ONE-TIME LEGAL SALE OF IVORY STOCKS IN 2008 WAS DESIGNED AS AN EXPERIMENT, BUT ITS GLOBAL IMPACT HAS NOT BEEN EVALUATED. WE FIND THAT INTERNATIONAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE LEGAL IVORY SALE CORRESPONDS WITH AN ABRUPT ~66% INCREASE IN ILLEGAL IVORY PRODUCTION ACROSS TWO CONTINENTS, AND A POSSIBLE TEN-FOLD INCREASE IN ITS TREND. AN ESTIMATED ~71% INCREASE IN IVORY SMUGGLING OUT OF AFRICA CORROBORATES THIS FINDING, WHILE CORRESPONDING PATTERNS ARE ABSENT FROM NATURAL MORTALITY AND ALTERNATIVE EXPLANATORY VARIABLES. THESE DATA SUGGEST THE WIDELY DOCUMENTED RECENT INCREASE IN ELEPHANT POACHING LIKELY ORIGINATED WITH THE LEGAL SALE. MORE GENERALLY, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CHANGES TO PRODUCER COSTS AND/OR CONSUMER DEMAND INDUCED BY LEGAL SALES CAN HAVE LARGER EFFECTS THAN DISPLACEMENT OF ILLEGAL PRODUCTION IN SOME GLOBAL BLACK MARKETS, IMPLYING THAT PARTIAL LEGALIZATION OF BANNED GOODS DOES NOT NECESSARILY REDUCE BLACK MARKET ACTIVITY.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (DECEMBER 2014)IT IS WIDELY HYPOTHESIZED THAT INCOMES IN WEALTHY COUNTRIES ARE INSULATED FROM ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS BECAUSE INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO ADAPT TO THEIR ENVIRONMENT. WE TEST THIS IDEA IN THE WEALTHIEST ECONOMY IN HUMAN HISTORY. USING WITHIN-COUNTY VARIATION IN WEATHER, WE ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF DAILY TEMPERATURE ON ANNUAL INCOME IN UNITED STATES COUNTIES OVER A 40-YEAR PERIOD. WE FIND THAT THIS SINGLE ENVIRONMENTAL PARAMETER CONTINUES TO PLAY A LARGE ROLE IN OVERALL ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE: PRODUCTIVITY OF INDIVIDUAL DAYS DECLINES ROUGHLY 1.7% FOR EACH 1°C (1.8°F) INCREASE IN DAILY AVERAGE TEMPERATURE ABOVE 15°C (59°F). A WEEKDAY ABOVE 30°C (86°F) COSTS AN AVERAGE COUNTY $20 PER PERSON. HOT WEEKENDS HAVE LITTLE EFFECT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE NET OF MANY FORMS OF ADAPTATION, SUCH AS FACTOR REALLOCATION, DEFENSIVE INVESTMENTS, TRANSFERS, AND PRICE CHANGES. BECAUSE THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE 1969, WE INFER THAT RECENT UPTAKE OR INNOVATION IN ADAPTATION MEASURES HAVE BEEN LIMITED. THE NON-LINEARITY OF THE EFFECT ON DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF INCOME SUGGEST THAT TEMPERATURE MATTERS BECAUSE IT REDUCES THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE ECONOMY'S BASIC ELEMENTS, SUCH AS WORKERS AND CROPS. IF COUNTIES COULD CHOOSE DAILY TEMPERATURES TO MAXIMIZE OUTPUT, RATHER THAN ACCEPTING THEIR GEOGRAPHICALLYDETERMINED ENDOWMENT, WE ESTIMATE THAT ANNUAL INCOME GROWTH WOULD RISE BY 1.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS. APPLYING OUR ESTIMATES TO A DISTRIBUTION OF ""BUSINESS AS USUAL"" CLIMATE CHANGE PROJECTIONS INDICATES THAT WARMER DAILY TEMPERATURES WILL LOWER ANNUAL GROWTH BY 0.06-0.16 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN THE UNITED STATES UNLESS POPULATIONS ENGAGE IN NEW FORMS OF ADAPTATION.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (JULY 2014)DOES THE ENVIRONMENT HAVE A CAUSAL EFFECT ON ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT? USING METEOROLOGICAL DATA, WE RECONSTRUCT EVERY COUNTRY'S EXPOSURE TO THE UNIVERSE OF TROPICAL CYCLONES DURING 1950-2008. WE EXPLOIT RANDOM WITHIN-COUNTRY YEAR-TO-YEAR VARIATION IN CYCLONE STRIKES TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS ON LONG-RUN GROWTH. WE COMPARE EACH COUNTRY'S GROWTH RATE TO ITSELF IN THE YEARS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE AND AFTER EXPOSURE, ACCOUNTING FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF CYCLONES IN PRECEDING YEARS. THE DATA REJECT HYPOTHESES THAT DISASTERS STIMULATE GROWTH OR THAT SHORT-RUN LOSSES DISAPPEAR FOLLOWING MIGRATIONS OR TRANSFERS OF WEALTH. INSTEAD, WE FIND ROBUST EVIDENCE THAT NATIONAL INCOMES DECLINE, RELATIVE TO THEIR PRE-DISASTER TREND, AND DO NOT RECOVER WITHIN TWENTY YEARS. BOTH RICH AND POOR COUNTRIES EXHIBIT THIS RESPONSE, WITH LOSSES MAGNIFIED IN COUNTRIES WITH LESS HISTORICAL CYCLONE EXPERIENCE. INCOME LOSSES ARISE FROM A SMALL BUT PERSISTENT SUPPRESSION OF ANNUAL GROWTH RATES SPREAD ACROSS THE FIFTEEN YEARS FOLLOWING DISASTER, GENERATING LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT CUMULATIVE EFFECTS: A 90TH PERCENTILE EVENT REDUCES PER CAPITA INCOMES BY 7.4% TWO DECADES LATER, EFFECTIVELY UNDOING 3.7 YEARS OF AVERAGE DEVELOPMENT. THE GRADUAL NATURE OF THESE LOSSES RENDER THEM INCONSPICUOUS TO A CASUAL OBSERVER, HOWEVER SIMULATIONS INDICATE THAT THEY HAVE DRAMATIC INFLUENCE OVER THE LONG-RUN DEVELOPMENT OF COUNTRIES THAT ARE ENDOWED WITH REGULAR OR CONTINUOUS EXPOSURE TO DISASTER. LINKING THESE RESULTS TO PROJECTIONS OF FUTURE CYCLONE ACTIVITY, WE ESTIMATE THAT UNDER CONSERVATIVE DISCOUNTING ASSUMPTIONS THE PRESENT DISCOUNTED COST OF ""BUSINESS AS USUAL"" CLIMATE CHANGE IS ROUGHLY $9.7 TRILLION LARGER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (FEBRUARY 2013)THE IMMEDIATE PHYSICAL DAMAGES CAUSED BY ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTERS ARE CONSPICUOUS AND OFTEN THE FOCUS OF MEDIA AND GOVERNMENT ATTENTION. IN CONTRAST, THE NATURE AND MAGNITUDE OF POST-DISASTER LOSSES REMAIN LARGELY UNKNOWN BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT EASILY OBSERVABLE. HERE WE EXPLOIT ANNUAL VARIATION IN THE INCIDENCE OF TYPHOONS (WEST-PACIFIC HURRICANES) TO IDENTIFY POST-DISASTER LOSSES WITHIN FILIPINO HOUSEHOLDS. WE FIND THAT UNEARNED INCOME AND EXCESS INFANT MORTALITY IN THE YEAR AFTER TYPHOON EXPOSURE OUTNUMBER IMMEDIATE DAMAGES AND DEATH TOLLS ROUGHLY 15-TO-1. TYPHOONS DESTROY DURABLE ASSETS AND DEPRESS INCOMES, LEADING TO BROAD EXPENDITURE REDUCTIONS ACHIEVED IN PART THROUGH DISINVESTMENTS IN HEALTH AND HUMAN CAPITAL. INFANT MORTALITY MIRRORS THESE ECONOMIC RESPONSES, AND ADDITIONAL FINDINGS -- THAT ONLY FEMALE INFANTS ARE AT RISK, THAT SIBLING COMPETITION ELEVATES RISK, AND THAT INFANTS CONCEIVED AFTER A TYPHOON ARE ALSO AT RISK -- INDICATE THAT THIS EXCESS MORTALITY RESULTS FROM HOUSEHOLD DECISIONS MADE WHILE COPING WITH POST-DISASTER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WE ESTIMATE THAT THESE POST-TYPHOON ""ECONOMIC DEATHS"" CONSTITUTE 13% OF THE OVERALL INFANT MORTALITY RATE IN THE PHILIPPINES. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE RESULTS INDICATE THAT ECONOMIC AND HUMAN LOSSES DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER MAY BE AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE LARGER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT AND THAT ADAPTIVE DECISION-MAKING MAY AMPLIFY, RATHER THAN DAMPEN, DISASTERS' SOCIAL COST.DOWNLOAD

REVIEW OF ENVIRONMENTAL ECONOMICS AND POLICY, VOLUME 13, ISSUE 1, WINTER 2019, PAGES 83–103,MOST REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO REDUCE ENVIRONMENTAL EXTERNALITIES IMPOSE COSTS ON INDIVIDUALS AND FIRMS. A LARGE AND GROWING LITERATURE EXAMINES WHETHER THESE COSTS ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY BORNE BY DIFFERENT SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY AND/OR ACROSS DIFFERENT GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS. HOWEVER, MUCH LESS IS KNOWN ABOUT HOW THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS CREATED BY THESE POLICIES ARE DISTRIBUTED, WHICH MIRROR THE DIFFERENCES IN ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL EXTERNALITIES.

WE APPLY THIS FRAMEWORK TO FINDINGS CONCERNING THE DISTRIBUTIONAL IMPACTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES FROM AIR POLLUTION, DEFORESTATION, AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND HIGHLIGHT PRIORITIES FOR FUTURE RESEARCH. A RECURRING CHALLENGE TO UNDERSTANDING THE DISTRIBUTIONAL EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGES IS DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN CASES IN WHICH POPULATIONS ARE EXPOSED TO DIFFERENT LEVELS OR CHANGES IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL GOOD AND THOSE IN WHICH AN INCREMENTAL CHANGE IN THE ENVIRONMENT MAY HAVE VERY DIFFERENT IMPLICATIONS FOR SOME POPULATIONS. IN THE LATTER CASE, IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO EMPIRICALLY IDENTIFY THE UNDERLYING SOURCES OF HETEROGENEITY IN MARGINAL DAMAGES BECAUSE DAMAGES MAY STEM FROM NONLINEAR AND/OR HETEROGENEOUS DAMAGE FUNCTIONS. NEVERTHELESS, UNDERSTANDING THE DETERMINANTS OF HETEROGENEITY IN ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS AND DAMAGES IS CRUCIAL FOR WELFARE ANALYSIS AND POLICY DESIGN.DOWNLOAD

WE CONCLUDE BY HIGHLIGHTING SOME KEY AREAS IN WHICH ECONOMISTS ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO HELP CLIMATE SCIENCE ADVANCE. AN IMPORTANT MESSAGE FROM THIS FINAL SECTION, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS DEEPLY UNDERAPPRECIATED AMONG ECONOMISTS, IS THAT ALL CLIMATE CHANGE FORECASTS RELY HEAVILY AND DIRECTLY ON ECONOMIC FORECASTS FOR THE WORLD.

ALTHOUGH SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT MAY INCREASE CROP YIELDS BY REDUCING HEAT STRESS, THE EFFECTS OF CONCOMITANT CHANGES IN AVAILABLE SUNLIGHT HAVE NEVER BEEN EMPIRICALLY ESTIMATED. HERE WE USE THE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS THAT INSPIRED MODERN SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS AS NATURAL EXPERIMENTS TO PROVIDE THE FIRST ESTIMATES, TO OUR KNOWLEDGE, OF HOW THE STRATOSPHERIC SULFATE AEROSOLS CREATED BY THE ERUPTIONS OF EL CHICHÓN AND MOUNT PINATUBO ALTERED THE QUANTITY AND QUALITY OF GLOBAL SUNLIGHT, AND HOW THESE CHANGES IN SUNLIGHT AFFECTED GLOBAL CROP YIELDS. WE FIND THAT THE SUNLIGHT-MEDIATED EFFECT OF STRATOSPHERIC SULFATE AEROSOLS ON YIELDS IS NEGATIVE FOR BOTH C4 (MAIZE) AND C3 (SOY, RICE AND WHEAT) CROPS. APPLYING OUR YIELD MODEL TO A SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT SCENARIO BASED ON STRATOSPHERIC SULFATE AEROSOLS, WE FIND THAT PROJECTED MID-TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY DAMAGES DUE TO SCATTERING SUNLIGHT CAUSED BY SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT ARE ROUGHLY EQUAL IN MAGNITUDE TO BENEFITS FROM COOLING. THIS SUGGESTS THAT SOLAR RADIATION MANAGEMENT—IF DEPLOYED USING STRATOSPHERIC SULFATE AEROSOLS SIMILAR TO THOSE EMITTED BY THE VOLCANIC ERUPTIONS IT SEEKS TO MIMIC—WOULD, ON NET, ATTENUATE LITTLE OF THE GLOBAL AGRICULTURAL DAMAGE FROM CLIMATE CHANGE.

IN PARTICULAR, IT IS UNKNOWN WHETHER THE RATE OF SUICIDE, A LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH GLOBALLY, IS SYSTEMATICALLY AFFECTED BY CLIMATIC CONDITIONS. USING COMPREHENSIVE DATA FROM MULTIPLE DECADES FOR BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO, WE FIND THAT SUICIDE RATES RISE 0.7% IN US COUNTIES AND 2.1% IN MEXICAN MUNICIPALITIES FOR A 1 °C INCREASE IN MONTHLY AVERAGE TEMPERATURE. THIS EFFECT IS SIMILAR IN HOTTER VERSUS COOLER REGIONS AND HAS NOT DIMINISHED OVER TIME, INDICATING LIMITED HISTORICAL ADAPTATION. ANALYSIS OF DEPRESSIVE LANGUAGE IN >600 MILLION SOCIAL MEDIA UPDATES FURTHER SUGGESTS THAT MENTAL WELL-BEING DETERIORATES DURING WARMER PERIODS. WE PROJECT THAT UNMITIGATED CLIMATE CHANGE (RCP8.5) COULD RESULT IN A COMBINED 9–40 THOUSAND ADDITIONAL SUICIDES (95% CONFIDENCE INTERVAL) ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO BY 2050, REPRESENTING A CHANGE IN SUICIDE RATES COMPARABLE TO THE ESTIMATED IMPACT OF ECONOMIC RECESSIONS, SUICIDE PREVENTION PROGRAMMES OR GUN RESTRICTION LAWS.DOWNLOAD

WE USE THIS APPROACH TO CONSTRUCT SPATIALLY EXPLICIT, PROBABILISTIC, AND EMPIRICALLY DERIVED ESTIMATES OF ECONOMIC DAMAGE IN THE UNITED STATES FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. THE COMBINED VALUE OF MARKET AND NONMARKET DAMAGE ACROSS ANALYZED SECTORS—AGRICULTURE, CRIME, COASTAL STORMS, ENERGY, HUMAN MORTALITY, AND LABOR—INCREASES QUADRATICALLY IN GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE, COSTING ROUGHLY 1.2% OF GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT PER +1°C ON AVERAGE. IMPORTANTLY, RISK IS DISTRIBUTED UNEQUALLY ACROSS LOCATIONS, GENERATING A LARGE TRANSFER OF VALUE NORTHWARD AND WESTWARD THAT INCREASES ECONOMIC INEQUALITY.

THE DISTANCES THEY MUST TRAVEL TO DO THIS DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH COOLER NEARBY SURFACES TEMPERATURES ARE. BECAUSE LARGE-SCALE ATMOSPHERIC DYNAMICS CONSTRAIN SURFACE TEMPERATURES TO BE NEARLY UNIFORM NEAR THE EQUATOR, THESE DISPLACEMENTS CAN GROW TO EXTREME DISTANCES IN THE TROPICS, EVEN UNDER RELATIVELY MILD WARMING SCENARIOS. HERE WE SHOW THAT IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THEIR ANNUAL MEAN TEMPERATURES, TROPICAL POPULATIONS WOULD HAVE TO TRAVEL DISTANCES GREATER THAN 1000 KM OVER LESS THAN A CENTURY IF GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE RISES BY 2 °C OVER THE SAME PERIOD. THE DISPROPORTIONATELY RAPID EVACUATION OF THE TROPICS UNDER SUCH A SCENARIO WOULD CAUSE MIGRANTS TO CONCENTRATE IN TROPICAL MARGINS AND THE SUBTROPICS, WHERE POPULATION DENSITIES WOULD INCREASE 300% OR MORE. THESE RESULTS MAY HAVE CRITICAL CONSEQUENCES FOR ECOSYSTEM AND HUMAN WELLBEING IN TROPICAL CONTEXTS WHERE ALTERNATIVES TO GEOGRAPHIC DISPLACEMENT ARE LIMITED.DOWNLOAD

GLOBAL NON-LINEAR EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON ECONOMIC PRODUCTION. NATURE 527, 235–239 (2015)GROWING EVIDENCE DEMONSTRATES THAT CLIMATIC CONDITIONS CAN HAVE A PROFOUND IMPACT ON THE FUNCTIONING OF MODERN HUMAN SOCIETIES, BUT EFFECTS ON ECONOMIC ACTIVITY APPEAR INCONSISTENT. FUNDAMENTAL PRODUCTIVE ELEMENTS OF MODERN ECONOMIES, SUCH AS WORKERS AND CROPS, EXHIBIT HIGHLY NON-LINEAR RESPONSES TO LOCAL TEMPERATURE EVEN IN WEALTHY COUNTRIES. IN CONTRAST, AGGREGATE MACROECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY OF ENTIRE WEALTHY COUNTRIES IS REPORTED NOT TO RESPOND TO TEMPERATURE, WHILE POOR COUNTRIES RESPOND ONLY LINEARLY. RESOLVING THIS CONFLICT BETWEEN MICRO AND MACRO OBSERVATIONS IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING THE ROLE OF WEALTH IN COUPLED HUMAN–NATURAL SYSTEMS AND TO ANTICIPATING THE GLOBAL IMPACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. HERE WE UNIFY THESE SEEMINGLY CONTRADICTORY RESULTS BY ACCOUNTING FOR NON-LINEARITY AT THE MACRO SCALE. WE SHOW THAT OVERALL ECONOMIC PRODUCTIVITY IS NON-LINEAR IN TEMPERATURE FOR ALL COUNTRIES, WITH PRODUCTIVITY PEAKING AT AN ANNUAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURE OF 13 °C AND DECLINING STRONGLY AT HIGHER TEMPERATURES. THE RELATIONSHIP IS GLOBALLY GENERALIZABLE, UNCHANGED SINCE 1960, AND APPARENT FOR AGRICULTURAL AND NON-AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY IN BOTH RICH AND POOR COUNTRIES. THESE RESULTS PROVIDE THE FIRST EVIDENCE THAT ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN ALL REGIONS IS COUPLED TO THE GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ESTABLISH A NEW EMPIRICAL FOUNDATION FOR MODELLING ECONOMIC LOSS IN RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE, WITH IMPORTANT IMPLICATIONS. IF FUTURE ADAPTATION MIMICS PAST ADAPTATION, UNMITIGATED WARMING IS EXPECTED TO RESHAPE THE GLOBAL ECONOMY BY REDUCING AVERAGE GLOBAL INCOMES ROUGHLY 23% BY 2100 AND WIDENING GLOBAL INCOME INEQUALITY, RELATIVE TO SCENARIOS WITHOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. IN CONTRAST TO PRIOR ESTIMATES, EXPECTED GLOBAL LOSSES ARE APPROXIMATELY LINEAR IN GLOBAL MEAN TEMPERATURE, WITH MEDIAN LOSSES MANY TIMES LARGER THAN LEADING MODELS INDICATE.DOWNLOAD

	THERE IS A LONG HISTORY OF USING WEATHER MEASURES AS EXPLANATORY VARIABLES IN STATISTICAL MODELS. FOR EXAMPLE, FISHER (1925) EXAMINED THE EFFECTS OF RAINFALL ON WHEAT YIELDS, ANDWRIGHT (1928) USED WEATHER AS AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE TO IDENTIFY A DEMAND FUNCTION FOR OILS. BECAUSE WEATHER IS EXOGENOUS AND RANDOM IN MOST ECONOMIC APPLICATIONS, IT ACTS LIKE A “NATURAL EXPERIMENT” AND THUS IN SOME SETTINGS ALLOWS RESEARCHERS TO IDENTIFY STATISTICALLY THE CAUSAL EFFECT OF ONE VARIABLE ON AN ECONOMIC OUTCOME OF INTEREST (ANGRIST AND KRUEGER 2001). THE RELATIVELY RECENT LITERATURE ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE HAS TURNED THE SPOTLIGHT ONTO QUANTIFYING THE EFFECT OF CLIMATE ON A NUMBER OF ECONOMIC OUTCOMES OF INTEREST (E.G., AGRICULTURAL YIELDS, MORTALITY RATES, ELECTRICITY AND WATER DEMAND). THIS LITERATURE HAS OFTEN FOUND A NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CLIMATE AND THESE OUTCOMES, WITH EXTREMELY WARM TEMPERATURES BEING ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT (E.G., SCHLENKER AND ROBERTS 2009). CLIMATE IS A LONG AVERAGE OF WEATHER AT A GIVEN LOCATION. TO IDENTIFY THE CAUSAL EFFECT OF CLIMATE ON THESE OUTCOMES, THE LITERATURE HAS GENERALLY RELIED ON EITHER CLIMATE NORMALS (I.E., LONG AVERAGES OF OBSERVED WEATHER IN A CROSS-SECTIONAL SETTING) OR DAY-TO-DAY (OR YEAR-TO-YEAR) FLUCTUATIONS IN OBSERVED WEATHER AS EXPLANATORY VARIABLES ACROSS TIME AND SPACE. THE ECONOMETRICIAN’S
	CHOICE OF A WEATHER VERSUS A CLIMATE MEASURE AS AN EXPLANATORY VARIABLE CRITICALLY AFFECTS THE INTERPRETATION OF THE ESTIMATED COEFFICIENTS IN THE ECONOMETRIC MODEL: THAT IS, WHETHER THE OUTCOME IS A TRUE CLIMATE RESPONSE OR A SHORT-RUN WEATHER ELASTICITY.DOWNLOAD

	UNDERSTANDING THE FEASIBILITY AND COST OF ADAPTATION IS ESSENTIAL TO MANAGEMENT OF THE GLOBAL CLIMATE. UNFORTUNATELY, WE LACK GENERAL ESTIMATES OF ADAPTIVE RESPONSES TO ALMOST ALL CLIMATOLOGICAL PROCESSES. TO ADDRESS THIS FOR ONE PHENOMENON, WE ESTIMATE THE EXTENT OF ADAPTATION TO TROPICAL CYCLONES (TCS) USING THE GLOBAL CROSS-SECTION OF COUNTRIES. WE RECONSTRUCT EVERY TC OBSERVED DURING 1950–2008 TO PARAMETERIZE COUNTRIES' TC CLIMATE AND YEAR-TO-YEAR TC EXPOSURE. WE THEN LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF ADAPTATION BY COMPARING DEATHS AND DAMAGES FROM PHYSICALLY SIMILAR TC EVENTS ACROSS COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERENT TC CLIMATOLOGIES. WE FIND THAT COUNTRIES WITH MORE INTENSE TC CLIMATES SUFFER LOWER MARGINAL LOSSES FROM AN ACTUAL TC EVENT, INDICATING THAT ADAPTATION TO THIS CLIMATOLOGICAL RISK OCCURS BUT THAT IT IS COSTLY. OVERALL, THERE IS STRONG EVIDENCE THAT IT IS BOTH FEASIBLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE FOR COUNTRIES WITH INTENSE TC CLIMATOLOGIES TO INVEST HEAVILY IN ADAPTATION. HOWEVER, MARGINAL CHANGES FROM COUNTRIES' CURRENT TC CLIMATES GENERATE PERSISTENT LOSSES, OF WHICH ONLY ~3% IS ""ADAPTED AWAY"" IN THE LONG RUN.
HSIANG, S.M., K.C. MENG, M.A. CANE. ""CIVIL CONFLICTS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE GLOBAL CLIMATE."" NATURE, VOL. 476, P. 438-441.
	IT HAS BEEN PROPOSED THAT CHANGES IN GLOBAL CLIMATE HAVE BEEN RESPONSIBLE FOR EPISODES OF WIDESPREAD VIOLENCE AND EVEN THE COLLAPSE OF CIVILIZATIONS. YET PREVIOUS STUDIES HAVE NOT SHOWN THAT VIOLENCE CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE GLOBAL CLIMATE, ONLY THAT RANDOM WEATHER EVENTS MIGHT BE CORRELATED WITH CONFLICT IN SOME CASES. HERE WE DIRECTLY ASSOCIATE PLANETARY-SCALE CLIMATE CHANGES WITH GLOBAL PATTERNS OF CIVIL CONFLICT BY EXAMINING THE DOMINANT INTERANNUAL MODE OF THE MODERN CLIMATE, THE EL NIN˜O/SOUTHERN OSCILLATION (ENSO). HISTORIANS HAVE ARGUED THAT ENSO MAY HAVE DRIVEN GLOBAL PATTERNS OF CIVIL CONFLICT IN THE DISTANT PAST, A HYPOTHESIS THAT WE EXTEND TO THE MODERN ERA AND TEST QUANTITATIVELY. USING DATA FROM 1950 TO 2004, WE SHOW THAT THE PROBABILITY OF NEW CIVIL CONFLICTS ARISING THROUGHOUT THE TROPICS DOUBLES DURING EL NIN˜O YEARS RELATIVE TO LA NIN˜A YEARS. THIS RESULT, WHICH INDICATES THAT ENSO MAY HAVE HAD A ROLE IN 21% OF ALL CIVIL CONFLICTS SINCE 1950, IS THE FIRST DEMONSTRATION THAT THE STABILITY OF MODERN SOCIETIES RELATES STRONGLY TO THE GLOBAL CLIMATE.DOWNLOAD

	UNDERSTANDING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF SURFACE TEMPERATURES IS AN IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR BOTH ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND CLIMATE CHANGE POLICY. THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT IN 28 CARIBBEAN-BASIN COUNTRIES, THE RESPONSE OF ECONOMIC OUTPUT TO INCREASED TEMPERATURES IS STRUCTURALLY SIMILAR TO THE RESPONSE OF LABOR PRODUCTIVITY TO HIGH TEMPERATURES, A MECHANISM OMITTED FROM ECONOMIC MODELS OF FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE. THIS SIMILARITY IS DEMONSTRATED BY ISOLATING THE DIRECT INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE FROM THAT OF TROPICAL CYCLONES, AN IMPORTANT CORRELATE. NOTABLY, OUTPUT LOSSES OCCURRING IN NONAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION (–2.4%/+1 °C) SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEED LOSSES OCCURRING IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION (–0.1%/+1 °C). THUS, THESE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT CURRENT MODELS OF FUTURE CLIMATE CHANGE THAT FOCUS ON AGRICULTURAL IMPACTS BUT OMIT THE RESPONSE OF WORKERS TO THERMAL STRESS MAY UNDERESTIMATE THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC COSTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (JANUARY 2020)FOR MOST OF US HISTORY, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT LET STATES CONDUCT CONGRESSIONAL ELECTIONS WITH ONLY MINIMAL INTERFERENCE. THIS CHANGED WITH CONGRESS’S PASSAGE OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT (1964) AND THE SUPREME COURT’S ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE (“OMOV”) DECISION IN CARR (1965). YET EVEN THEN THE SUPREME COURT STOPPED SHORT OF OVERRULING GERRYMANDERED CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICTS. FIFTEEN YEARS AGO, JUSTICE KENNEDY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT WORKABLE APPROACHES STILL DID NOT EXIST, BUT CHALLENGED LITIGANTS TO DO BETTER. THE SUPREME COURT’S DEVASTATING OPINION IN RUCHO V. COMMON CAUSE (2019) MARKS THE END OF THIS EXPERIMENT.THE QUESTION REMAINS WHETHER SOME FRESH DEPARTURE CAN SATISFY THE COURT’S OBJECTIONS.THIS PAPER INVESTIGATES THE LEADING CANDIDATES. THE MOST CONSERVATIVE POSSIBILITY IS TO TIGHTEN TRADITIONAL VISUAL CRITERIA LIKE “CONTIGUITY” AND “COMPACTNESS” TO MAKE THEM BINDING. WE PRESENT DETAILED NUMERICAL ARGUMENTS SHOWING THAT SUCH RULES WOULD HAVE TO BE SO STRINGENT AS TO DEPRIVE LEGISLATORS OF PRACTICALLY ALL DISCRETION IN DRAWING LINES. THIS, HOWEVER, WOULD SPLIT COMMUNITIES AT RANDOM. WE ARGUE THAT THIS (A) VIOLATES OMOV JUST AS A DELIBERATE GERRYMANDER WOULD, AND (B) DISRUPTS GRASSROOTS NETWORKS THAT VOTERS RELY ON TO EDUCATE THEMSELVES, MAKING VOTES LESS VALUABLE TO THOSE WHO CAST THEM. IT FOLLOWS THAT OMOV IS ALWAYS IMPROVED BY REPLACING RANDOM DISTRICTING WITH DETERMINATE RULES THAT TRACK COMMUNITIES.OUR SECOND CANDIDATE IMPLEMENTS THIS STRATEGY. REMARKABLY, RECENT SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH SHOWS (A) THAT EDUCATION AND SOCIAL PRESSURE ACROSS VOTERS PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN SHAPING COMMUNITY OPINION, AND (B) THAT THE PROBABILITY OF SUCH INTERACTIONS BETWEEN VOTERS CAN BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED FROM AN INVERSE SQUARE LAW. WE DESCRIBE A NEW OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE PROGRAM THAT USES THESE INSIGHTS TO TRACK COMMUNITY AND TEST IT AGAINST COUNTY-LEVEL POPULATION DATA FROM TEXAS. WE SHOW THAT THE RESULTING MAPS ARE VISUALLY SIMILAR TO THOSE PRODUCED BY LEGISLATURES; ARE FULLY DETERMINATE; EFFICIENTLY BALANCE OMOV CONSTRAINTS AGAINST RESPECT FOR COMMUNITY; AND ARE ROBUST AGAINST MANIPULATION. THE CHIEF DOWNSIDE IS THAT SOME DISTRICTS ARE DISCONTINUOUS, ALTHOUGH THIS IS RARE AND COULD BE MITIGATED EVEN FURTHER. IN THE MEANTIME, OUR ALGORITHM PROVIDES A VALUABLE SAFE HARBOR FOR STATES HOPING TO AVOID FUTURE COURT CHALLENGES, AN ATTRACTIVE MODEL FOR REFORM LEGISLATION, AND A TRANSPARENT BENCHMARK FOR EXPOSING GERRYMANDERS TO PUBLIC SCRUTINY.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER (MARCH 2019)THE GENIUS OF THE FRAMERS LAY IN IDENTIFYING AND SYSTEMATICALLY PLANNING FOR THE KNOWN PATHOLOGIES OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT. THAT SAID, MOST OF THEIR EVIDENCE WAS LIMITED TO GREEK AND ROMAN HISTORY. THIS GAVE LITTLE WARNING OF THE DISASTROUS POLARIZATION THAT WOULD DESTABILIZE EUROPEAN MASS DEMOCRACIES OVER THE NEXT TWO CENTURIES. THIS PAPER ASKS HOW THE FRAMERS MIGHT HAVE EXTENDED THEIR DESIGN HAD THEY UNDERSTOOD THESE DANGERS.WE START BY NOTING THAT THE WELL-KNOWN “MEDIAN VOTER THEOREM,” WHICH HOLDS THAT SUCCESSFUL AMERICAN POLITICAL PARTIES MUST POSITION THEMSELVES NEAR THE CENTER, DEPENDS ON VERY SPECIAL ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW PUBLIC OPINION IS ACTUALLY DISTRIBUTED. THIS IMPLIES THAT AMERICAN POLITICS CAN AND PROBABLY WILL BEHAVE VERY DIFFERENTLY AS POLARIZATION INCREASES. THIS PAPER PRESENTS A TYPOLOGY OF POSSIBLE POLARIZATIONS, AND ARGUES FROM BOTH THEORY AND HISTORY THAT EACH IS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS OWN UNIQUE POLITICAL STYLE. SIGNIFICANTLY, ONLY SOME OF THESE STYLES FAVOR CONSENSUS POLITICS. OTHERS ARE CONFRONTATIONAL, WITH EXTREMISTS DELIBERATELY SABOTAGING GOVERNMENT TO COERCE OPPONENTS. RECENT GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS ARE AN EXTREME EXPRESSION OF THESE TACTICS.ONE PECULIARITY OF COERCIVE POLITICS IS THAT IT DEPENDS AT LEAST AS MUCH ON POLITICAL PASSION (“INTENSITY”) AS RAW VOTE TOTALS. ASKING WHETHER SUCH POLITICS ARE DEMOCRATICALLY LEGITIMATE NECESSARILY FORCES US BEYOND THE FAMILIAR LANGUAGE OF ONE-MAN-ONE-VOTE (“OMOV”) THEORIES THAT COUNT ALL VOTES EQUALLY. THIS PHILOSOPHICAL QUESTION ALSO HAS A PRACTICAL SIDE. AFTER ALL, NO REAL GOVERNMENT CAN GO ON PASSING LAWS THAT INCREASE PUBLIC ANGER FOREVER. THE PAPER DEVELOPS A SIMPLE BASELINE MODEL OF INTENSITY-WEIGHTED VOTING AND ASKS HOW FAMILIAR AMERICAN RULES LIKE SUPERMAJORITIES, PRESIDENTIAL VETOES, AND FILIBUSTERS HAVE MODIFIED OMOV TO AVOID OPPRESSIVE OUTCOMES IN THE PAST. IN DOING SO, WE RELY HEAVILY ON EUROPEAN HISTORICAL PRECEDENTS AND ASK HOW THESE MIGHT CHANGE IN AMERICAN CIRCUMSTANCES.WE ARGUE THAT COERCIVE POLITICS, WHILE SOMETIMES PATHOLOGICAL, IS AN ESSENTIAL TOOL FOR MEASURING AND ACCOMMODATING VOTER INTENSITY. IT FOLLOWS THAT REFORM SHOULD AIM LESS TO SUPPRESS COERCIVE METHODS THAN TO MAKE THEM LESS COSTLY. WE ARGUE THAT SUITABLY REFORMED VERSIONS OF GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWNS, SUPERMAJORITIES, SUNSET LEGISLATION, REGULAR ORDER, AND STIFFENED RULE OF LAW INCENTIVES OFFER THE FASTEST PATH TO RESTORING COOPERATIVE POLITICS.DOWNLOAD 
								THE HEALING CONSTITUTION (666KB)WORKING PAPER (APRIL 2018)SCIENTISTS HAVE LONG RECOGNIZED TWO DISTINCT FORMS OF HUMAN THOUGHT. “TYPE 1” REASONING IS UNCONSCIOUS, INTUITIVE, AND SPECIALIZES IN FINDING COMPLEX PATTERNS. IT IS TYPICALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE AESTHETIC EMOTION THAT JOHN KEATS CALLED “BEAUTY.” “TYPE 2” REASONING IS CONSCIOUS, ARTICULABLE, AND DEDUCTIVE. SCHOLARS USUALLY ASSUME THAT LEGAL REASONING IS ENTIRELY TYPE 2. HOWEVER, CRITICS FROM HOLMES TO POSNER HAVE PROTESTED THAT UNCONSCIOUS AND INTUITIVE JUDGMENTS ARE AT LEAST COMPARABLY IMPORTANT. THIS ARTICLE TAKES THE CONJECTURE SERIOUSLY BY ASKING WHAT SCIENCE CAN ADD TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF HOW LAWYERS AND JUDGES INTERPRET LEGAL TEXTS.THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO TAKE STOCK. RECENT ADVANCES IN COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY, BRAIN IMAGING, AND NEURAL NETWORK THEORY HAVE ALREADY PUSHED MANY HUMANITIES SCHOLARS TO RETHINK POSTMODERN INTERPRETATIONS THAT PRIVILEGE POLITICS AND CULTURE OVER TEXTS. THIS ARTICLE ARGUES THAT A PARALLEL SHIFT IS OVERDUE IN LAW AND THAT TYPE 1 REASONING, WHICH SPECIALIZES IN PATTERN RECOGNITION, PROVIDES A NATURAL EXPLANATION FOR HOW JUDGES CHOOSE AMONG COMPETING LEGAL THEORIES. FINALLY, AND MOST SURPRISINGLY, THE ARTICLE DOCUMENTS COGNITIVE PSYCHOLOGY EVIDENCE SHOWING THAT TYPE 1 JUDGMENTS SHOW SIGNIFICANT UNIVERSALITY, I.E. THAT HUMANS WHO STUDY SUBJECTS FOR LONG PERIODS OFTEN MAKE SIMILAR CHOICES WITHOUT REGARD TO THE SOCIETIES THEY WERE BORN INTO. THIS SOLVES A LONG-STANDING DIFFICULTY IN JURISPRUDENCE, WHICH OFTEN STRUGGLES TO EXPLAIN WHY ONE LEGAL INTERPRETATION SHOULD BE MORE CONVINCING THAN ANOTHER. THE REST OF THE ARTICLE ANALYZES HOW TYPE 1 THINKING ENTERS INTO LEGAL REASONING AND OUTCOMES. IT BEGINS BY REVIEWING 19TH CENTURY THEORIES THAT CLAIMED A LEADING ROLE FOR INTUITIVE REASONING IN PUBLIC POLICY. IT THEN UPDATES THESE THEORIES TO ACCOMMODATE THE RELATIVELY WEAK STATISTICAL CORRELATIONS THAT PSYCHOLOGISTS HAVE DOCUMENTED, ARGUING THAT MODERN COURT SYSTEMS AMPLIFY THESE SIGNALS IN APPROXIMATELY DETERMINATE WAYS. IT ALSO EXPLAINS WHY ADVOCATES SHOULD RATIONALLY PREFER FORMALIST JUDGES TO PRAGMATIC ONES. CRUCIALLY, THE EXISTENCE OF UNIVERSALITY IMPLIES A MEASURE OF AGREEMENT ACROSS ALL LAWYERS REGARDLESS OF PERSONAL BIAS OR POLITICS. THIS COMMON GROUND GIVES JUDGES A RELIABLY NEUTRAL BASIS FOR DECIDING CASES.

ALMOST ALL OF THESE ARE BASED ON LARGE RETAILERS’ ECONOMIC LEVERAGE OVER GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS. THIS ARTICLE DOCUMENTS COMMONALITIES IN SIX OF THE BEST-STUDIED EXAMPLES – COFFEE, DOLPHIN-SAFE TUNA, FISHERIES, LUMBER, FOOD PROCESSING, AND ARTIFICIAL DNA – AND OFFERS STRAIGHTFORWARD ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL THEORIES TO EXPLAIN THEM. THE THEORIES TEACH THAT OLIGOPOLY COMPETITION CAN STRONGLY CONSTRAIN PRIVATE POWER SO THAT FIRMS ARE ANSWERABLE TO A SHADOW ELECTORATE OF CONSUMERS. FURTHERMORE, RATIONAL RETAILERS WILL FIND CEDE SIGNIFICANT POWER TO SUPPLIERS AND NGOS. THE ARGUMENTS GENERALIZE TRADITIONAL CLAIMS THAT FREE MARKETS CONSTRAIN PRIVATE POWER AND SUGGEST AN EXPLICIT FRAMEWORK FOR DECIDING WHEN PRIVATE POLITICS ARE LEGITIMATE.DOWNLOAD 
								AVAILABLE AT SSRN WORKING PAPER: GSPP15-001 (APRIL 2015)LEGAL SCHOLARS USUALLY ANALYZE COPYRIGHT AS AN INCENTIVE AND SOMETIME OBSTACLE TO CREATION. THIS ENCOURAGES US TO SEE PUBLISHERS AS MIDDLEMEN WHO SIPHON OFF RENTS THAT WOULD BE BETTER SPENT ON AUTHORS. BY COMPARISON, RECENT SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH EMPHASIZES THAT WORD-OF-MOUTH MARKETS ARE HIGHLY IMPERFECT. THIS MEANS THAT MANY DESERVING TITLES WILL NEVER FIND READERS UNLESS SOME PUBLISHER TAKES THE TROUBLE TO MARKET THEM. BUT THIS SECOND VIEW IS DEEPLY SUBVERSIVE. AFTER ALL, THE NEED FOR PUBLISHERS – AND REWARD – DOES NOT END WHEN A BOOK IS PUBLISHED. AT LEAST IN PRINCIPLE, COPYRIGHT SHOULD LAST FOREVER. 

THE TROUBLE WITH THIS ARGUMENT IS THAT IT ASSUMES WHAT OUGHT TO BE PROVEN. HOW MUCH EFFORT DO PUBLISHERS REALLY INVEST IN FINDING FORGOTTEN TITLES? AND DOES VIGOROUS MARKETING ATTRACT MORE READERS THAN HIGH COPYRIGHT PRICES DETER? THIS ARTICLE LOOKS FOR ANSWERS IN THE HISTORY OF 20TH CENTURY PRINT PUBLISHERS AND TODAY’S PRINT-ON-DEMAND AND EBOOK MARKETS. WE ARGUE THAT, FAR FROM PROMOTING DISSEMINATION, COPYRIGHT FREQUENTLY OPERATES TO SUPPRESS WORKS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE ERODE THE PRICE OF NEW TITLES. THIS PATHOLOGY HAS GOTTEN DRAMATICALLY WORSE IN THE AGE OF EBOOKS. MEANWHILE, PUBLIC DOMAIN PUBLISHERS ARE FACING THEIR OWN CRISIS. MID-20TH CENTURY BOOKS HAD LARGE UP-FRONT COSTS. THIS DETERRED COPYISTS. BY COMPARISON, DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES MAKE IT EASY FOR COPYISTS TO ENTER THE MARKET. THIS HAS SUPPRESSED PROFITS TO THE POINT WHERE MANY PUBLIC DOMAIN PUBLISHERS SPEND LITTLE OR NOTHING ON FORGOTTEN TITLES.

THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY REVIEWING POSSIBLE REFORMS. PARTIAL SOLUTIONS INCLUDE CLARIFYING ANTITRUST LAW SO THAT FIRMS HAVE MORE FREEDOM TO IMPLEMENT PRICE DISCRIMINATION; MODIFYING COPYRIGHT SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN RE-SELL USED EBOOKS; LETTING ON-LINE MARKETS LIMIT THE NUMBER OF PUBLISHERS ALLOWED TO POST REDUNDANT PUBLIC DOMAIN TITLES ON THEIR SITES; AND STRENGTHENING NON-COMMERCIAL INSTITUTIONS FOR FINDING, CURATING, AND DELIVERING QUALITY TITLES TO READERS.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER: GSPP14-002 (JUNE 2014)COPYRIGHT THEORISTS OFTEN ASK HOW INCENTIVES CAN BE DESIGNED TO CREATE BETTER BOOKS, MOVIES, AND ART. BUT THIS IS NOT THE WHOLE STORY. AS THE ROMAN SATIRIST MARTIAL POINTED OUT TWO THOUSAND YEARS AGO, MARKETS ROUTINELY IGNORE GOOD AND EVEN EXCELLENT WORKS. THE INSIGHT REMINDS US THAT INCENTIVES TO FIND CONTENT ARE JUST AS NECESSARY AS INCENTIVES TO MAKE IT. RECENT SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH EXPLAINS WHY MARKETS FAIL AND HOW TIMELY INTERVENTIONS CAN SAVE DESERVING TITLES FROM OBLIVION. THIS ARTICLE REVIEWS SOCIETY’S LONG STRUGGLE TO FIX THE VAGARIES OF SEARCH SINCE THE INVENTION OF LITERATURE. WE BUILD ON THIS HISTORY TO SUGGEST POLICIES FOR THE EMERGING WORLD OF ONLINE MEDIA.HOMERIC LITERATURE WAS PRODUCED AND DISSEMINATED THROUGH DIRECT INTERACTIONS BETWEEN AUDIENCES AND AUTHORS. THOUGH APPEALING IN MANY WAYS, THE PROCESS WAS AGONIZINGLY SLOW. BY THE 1ST CENTURY AD COMMERCIAL PUBLISHERS HAD MOVED TO THE MODERN MODEL OF CHARGING READERS ABOVE-COST PRICES TO PAY FOR SEARCH AND MARKETING. CRUCIALLY, THE NEW MODEL WAS ONLY SUSTAINABLE SO LONG AS FIRMS COULD SUPPRESS COPYING. WE ARGUE THAT ROMAN AND EARLY MODERN PUBLISHERS DEVELOPED REMARKABLY SUCCESSFUL SELF-HELP STRATEGIES TO DO THIS. HOWEVER, THEIR METHODS DID LITTLE TO SUPPRESS COPYING AFTER THE FIRST EDITION. THIS SEEMINGLY MODEST DEFECT MADE PUBLISHERS PROFOUNDLY RISK AVERSE. ANCIENT BEST-SELLER LISTS WERE INVARIABLY DOMINATED BY AUTHORS WHO HAD BEEN DEAD FOR CENTURIES.PUBLISHERS’ SELF-HELP SYSTEMS COLLAPSED UNDER A WAVE OF PIRACY IN THE MID-17TH CENTURY. THIS LED TO THE FIRST MODERN COPYRIGHT STATUTES. CRUCIALLY, THE NEW LAWS EXTENDED PROTECTION BEYOND THE FIRST EDITION. THIS ENCOURAGED MODERN BUSINESS MODELS IN WHICH PUBLISHERS GAMBLE ON A DOZEN TITLES FOR EACH THAT SUCCEEDS. THE ENSUING PROLIFERATION OF TITLES HELPED FUEL THE ENLIGHTENMENT. IT ALSO PROMOTED A RICH NEW ECOSYSTEM OF SEARCH INSTITUTIONS INCLUDING LIBRARIES, NEWSPAPER CRITICS, AND EDITORS.THE DIGITAL AGE HAS CHANGED EVERYTHING. AS COPYRIGHT FADES, THE OLD INSTITUTIONS FOR FINDING TITLES ARE DRYING UP. WE EXPLORE SEVERAL POSSIBLE RESPONSES. FIRST, SOCIETY CAN SHORE UP CURRENT PUBLISHING MODELS BY EXPANDING COPYRIGHT AND TECHNICAL PROTECTIONS. WE ARGUE THAT THESE METHODS CANNOT SAVE BOOK SEARCH BUT MIGHT BE ADEQUATE FOR MUSIC AND MOVIES. SECOND, SEARCH ENGINES COULD PAY FOR EDITORS. WE ARGUE THAT AN ON-LINE DIGITAL BOOKSTORE CAN SUPPRESS COPYISTS LONG ENOUGH TO FUND REASONABLE SEARCH EFFORTS. FINALLY, SOCIETY CAN RETURN TO THE HOMERIC PATTERN OF HARVESTING ADVICE DIRECTLY FROM AUDIENCES. WE EXPLORE VARIOUS COMMERCIAL AND OPEN SOURCE INSTITUTIONS FOR ORGANIZING THE WORK.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER: GSPP14-001 (FEBRUARY 2014)FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS, LARGE CORPORATIONS HAVE ROUTINELY DEVELOPED AND ENFORCED INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS TO ADDRESS PROBLEMS THAT ARE ONLY DISTANTLY RELATED TO EARNING A PROFIT. THIS INCLUDES WRITING DETAILED PRIVATE REGULATIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, NATIONAL SECURITY, WORKING CONDITIONS, AND OTHER TOPICS FORMERLY RESERVED TO GOVERNMENTS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE US SUPREME COURT HAS SAID THAT THE SHERMAN ACT FORBIDS ANY “EXTRA-GOVERNMENTAL AGENCY” THAT “PROVIDES EXTRA-JUDICIAL TRIBUNALS FOR THE DETERMINATION AND PUNISHMENT OF VIOLATIONS.” THIS SEEMS TO BAN ENFORCEABLE RULES. DESPITE THIS, MANY US POLICYMAKERS CONTINUE TO ARGUE THAT PRIVATE STANDARDS ARE EFFICIENT AND DESIRABLE. MANY CORPORATIONS ARE SYMPATHETIC BUT FEAR LEGAL LIABILITY AND ARE RELUCTANT TO PARTICIPATE UNLESS AND UNTIL THE LAW IS CLARIFIED.THIS ARTICLE ASKS HOW EXISTING LAW CAN BE REFORMED TO ARRIVE AT PRINCIPLED RULES FOR DECIDING WHEN PRIVATE STANDARDS VIOLATE THE SHERMAN ACT. WE BEGIN WITH AN HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF RECENT PRIVATE INITIATIVES TO REGULATE FOOD PROCESSING, FISHERIES, FORESTRY, AND COFFEE PRODUCTION. WE ARGUE THAT THESE PRIVATE RULES ARE OFTEN JUST AS EFFECTIVE – AND BURDENSOME – AS GOVERNMENT REGULATION. WE THEN GENERALIZE FROM THIS EVIDENCE TO EXPLAIN WHEN AND HOW LARGE CORPORATIONS ARE ABLE TO IMPOSE THEIR PREFERENCES THROUGH INDUSTRY-WIDE STANDARDS. WE ALSO DESCRIBE THE POLITICS THAT DETERMINES HOW LARGE CORPORATIONS USE THEIR POWER. WE ARGUE THAT THE NEED TO EARN POSITIVE PROFIT AND DEFEND MARKET SHARE FREQUENTLY ENCOURAGES – AND SOMETIMES FORCES – LARGE COMPANIES TO CHOOSE STANDARDS THAT PLEASE CONSUMERS. IN THESE CASES, CONSUMERS ACT AS A SHADOW ELECTORATE THAT CONSTRAINS PRIVATE POWER IN MUCH THE SAME WAY THAT REAL VOTERS CONSTRAIN ELECTED OFFICIALS. FINALLY, OUR EXAMPLES SHOW THAT BIG CORPORATIONS OFTEN DECIDE TO SHARE POWER WITH SMALLER RIVALS, SUPPLIERS, NGOS, AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. WE ARGUE THAT THESE DELEGATIONS ARE GENUINE AND MAKE PRIVATE STANDARDS MORE ACCOUNTABLE.THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY ASKING HOW CURRENT LAW CAN BE REFORMED. WE ARGUE THAT THE SHERMAN ACT SERVES TWO GOALS. THE FIRST IS ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. WE ARGUE THAT PRIVATE STANDARDS ADVANCE THIS GOAL BY ADDRESSING PROBLEMS (“EXTERNALITIES”) THAT LACK WELL-DEFINED MARKET PRICES. WE ARGUE THAT PRIVATE BODIES SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ADDRESS SUCH PROBLEMS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE KNOWING THAT GOVERNMENT MAY LATER STEP IN TO CHANGE OR SUPPLEMENT POLICY. THE SECOND GOAL IS TO PROTECT DEMOCRACY FROM PRIVATE POWER. WE ARGUE THAT THIS DANGER IS MINIMAL SO LONG AS (A) MARKET STRUCTURE ENCOURAGES CORPORATIONS TO MAKE CHOICES THAT PLEASE CONSUMERS AND OTHER SHADOW ELECTORATES, (B) THE STANDARD SETTING BODY REPRESENTS A WIDE RANGE OF AFFECTED STAKEHOLDERS, OR (C) INDUSTRY SELECTS THE PREVAILING STANDARD FROM MULTIPLE COMPETING PROPOSALS. SIGNIFICANTLY, ALL OF THESE TESTS CAN BE DETERMINED FROM OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE WITHOUT OBSCURE METAPHYSICAL INQUIRIES INTO WHEN PRIVATE POWER BECOMES “ILLEGITIMATE” OR “POSES A THREAT” TO DEMOCRATIC POLITICS.DOWNLOAD

	THE US SUPREME COURT’S DECISION IN GRAHAM V. JOHN DEERE (1966) PLACED NEOCLASSICAL ECONOMIC INSIGHTS AT THE HEART OF MODERN PATENT LAW. BUT ECONOMIC THEORY HAS MOVED ON. SINCE THE 1990S, LEGAL SCHOLARS HAVE REPEATEDLY MINED THE DISCIPLINE TO PROPOSE AD HOC RULES FOR INDIVIDUAL INDUSTRIES LIKE BIOTECH AND SOFTWARE. SO FAR, HOWEVER, THEY HAVE ALMOST ALWAYS IGNORED THE LITERATURE’S BROADER LESSONS FOR DOCTRINE. THIS ARTICLE ASKS HOW WELL TODAY’S PATENT DOCTRINE FOLLOWS AND OCCASIONALLY DEPARTS FROM MODERN ECONOMIC PRINCIPLES.
THE ARTICLE STARTS BY REVIEWING WHAT INNOVATION ECONOMISTS HAVE LEARNED SINCE THE 1970S. WHILE IT IS CONVENTIONAL FOR LEGAL SCHOLARS TO DIVIDE THE NEOCLASSICAL LITERATURE INTO MULTIPLE COMPETING “THEORIES,” SHARED MATHEMATICAL METHODS AND MODELING ASSUMPTIONS (E.G. PROFIT-MAXIMIZATION) GUARANTEE THAT THE NEOCLASSICAL LITERATURE’S VARIOUS STRANDS CANNOT DISAGREE IN ANY FUNDAMENTAL WAY. FOR THIS REASON, WHATEVER DIFFERENCES EXIST IN THE NEOCLASSICAL LITERATURE ARE MORE ACCURATELY SEEN AS SPECIAL CASES OF A SINGLE UNDERLYING THEORY. WE ARGUE THAT THIS UNDERLYING THEORY MUST INCLUDE AT LEAST THREE PRINCIPLES. THE FIRST LIMITS REWARD TO NON-OBVIOUS INVENTIONS AND EXPLICITLY ENTERED THE LAW THROUGH GRAHAM’S PHOSITA STANDARD. THE SECOND PRINCIPLE HOLDS THAT PATENT BREADTH SHOULD BE CHOSEN TO BALANCE THE BENEFITS OF INNOVATION AGAINST THE COSTS OF MONOPOLY. THOUGH WIDELY RECOGNIZED BY JUDGES AND SCHOLARS, THE PRINCIPLE’S INFLUENCE ON DOCTRINE REMAINS REMARKABLY INCOHERENT. THE FINAL PRINCIPLE PRESCRIBES RULES FOR ALLOCATING PATENT REWARDS WHERE MULTIPLE INVENTORS CONTRIBUTE TO A SHARED TECHNOLOGY. UNLIKE THE FIRST TWO PRINCIPLES, THIS INSIGHT WAS UNKNOWN IN THE 1960S AND HAS YET TO ENTER THE LAW.
	REMARKABLY, PATENT DOCTRINE USES A SINGLE CONCEPT – GRAHAM’S “PERSON HAVING ORDINARY SKILL IN THE ART” OR “PHOSITA” – TO ADDRESS ALL THREE PRINCIPLES. THIS MEANS THAT DOCTRINAL SOLUTIONS FOR ONE PRINCIPLE CAN HAVE UNINTENDED IMPACTS ON THE OTHERS. IN SOME CASES, THIS LINK IS OPTIONAL. FOR EXAMPLE, THE ARTICLE SHOWS HOW THE PHOSITA CONCEPT COULD BE GENERALIZED TO PROVIDE SEPARATE AND DISTINCT TESTS FOR, SAY, NON-OBVIOUSNESS AND PATENT BREADTH. HOWEVER, OTHER LINKS ARE MANDATORY. IN PARTICULAR, THE ARTICLE SHOWS THAT ANY DOCTRINAL ARCHITECTURE BUILT ON GRAHAM’S PHOSITA TEST AUTOMATICALLY ALLOCATES REWARD AMONG SUCCESSIVE INVENTORS. THOUGH REASONABLE, THESE DEFAULT OUTCOMES FALL SHORT OF THE ECONOMIC IDEAL. THE ARTICLE ANALYZES HOW CHANGES IN THE UTILITY, BLOCKING PATENTS, REVERSE DOCTRINE OF EQUIVALENTS, AND THE WRITTEN DESCRIPTION DOCTRINES CAN MITIGATE THIS PROBLEM. HOWEVER, OTHER GAPS ARE INHERENT AND CANNOT BE ELIMINATED WITHOUT ABANDONING GRAHAM ITSELF. THIS RADICALLY REVISED ARCHITECTURE WOULD PROBABLY CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS THAN IT SOLVES.DOWNLOAD

	SYNTHETIC BIOLOGISTS HAVE VIGOROUSLY DEBATED THE NEED FOR COMMUNITY-WIDE BIOSECURITY STANDARDS FOR THE PAST DECADE. DESPITE THIS, THE US GOVERNMENT’S OFFICIAL RESPONSE HAS BEEN LIMITED TO WEAK AND ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES. THIS ARTICLE DESCRIBES ATTEMPTS BY JOURNAL EDITORS, ACADEMIC SCIENTISTS, AND COMMERCIAL FIRMS TO ORGANIZE PRIVATE ALTERNATIVES AT THE GRASSROOTS LEVEL. PRIVATE COMMERCIAL STANDARDS, IN PARTICULAR, ARE SIGNIFICANTLY STRONGER THAN FEDERAL GUIDELINES AND CURRENTLY OPERATE ACROSS MORE THAN EIGHTY PERCENT OF THE SYNTHETIC DNA INDUSTRY. THE PAPER GENERALIZES FROM THESE EXAMPLES BY ASKING WHEN STRONG PRIVATE STANDARDS ARE BOTH FEASIBLE AND LIKELY TO PRODUCE OUTCOMES THAT ARE COMPARABLY DEMOCRATIC TO CONVENTIONAL AGENCY REGULATION. IT CLOSES BY DESCRIBING INTERVENTIONS THAT GOVERNMENT CAN USE TO PROMOTE AND MANAGE GRASSROOTS STANDARDS INITIATIVES.DOWNLOAD

	MANY OBSERVERS ARE SKEPTICAL OF CLAIMS THAT PRIVATE ENTREPRENEURS CAN PERFORM TRADITIONAL GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTIONS LIKE SUPPORTING BASIC RESEARCH, KEEPING WMD AWAY FROM TERRORISTS, OR PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS ARTICLE PRESENTS FIVE RECENT COUNTEREXAMPLES. THESE INCLUDE INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO ESTABLISH NEW HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS IN NANOTECHNOLOGY; BUILD A CENTRAL REPOSITORY FOR WORLDWIDE MUTATIONS DATA; USE ON-LINE VOLUNTEERS TO FIND CURES FOR TUBERCULOSIS; AND REQUIRE BIOTECH COMPANIES TO SCREEN CUSTOMER ORDERS FOR PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE USED TO MAKE WEAPONS. IN PRINCIPLE, MANY MORE INITIATIVES ARE BOTH POSSIBLE AND DESIRABLE. HISTORICALLY, HOWEVER, GOVERNMENT DONE LITTLE TO PROMOTE PRIVATE INITIATIVES AND SOMETIMES DESTABILIZED THEM.

WMD TECHNOLOGIES ARE INCREASINGLY AVAILABLE FROM COMMERCIAL FIRMS LOCATED ALL OVER THE WORLD. SCHOLARS POINT OUT THAT TRADITIONAL POLITICAL INITIATIVES BASED ON REGULATION AND TREATY WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY CONTROLLING THIS COMPLEX ENVIRONMENT. BY COMPARISON, MARKET FORCES ROUTINELY IMPOSE UNIFORM, WORLDWIDE STANDARDS (E.G. WINDOWS SOFTWARE, BLU-RAY VIDEO PLAYERS) IN MANY HIGH TECH INDUSTRIES. RECENTLY, THE COMPANIES IN ONE SUCH INDUSTRY (ARTIFICIAL DNA) USED THESE SAME ECONOMIC FORCES TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A BIOSECURITY STANDARD. SURPRISINGLY, THE RESULTING STANDARD IS MORE STRINGENT – AND AT LEAST ARGUABLY MORE ENFORCEABLE – THAN THE US GOVERNMENT’S OWN OFFICIAL GUIDELINES. THIS ARTICLE BEGINS BY PRESENTING A SHORT HISTORY OF HOW PRIVATE AND PUBLIC STANDARDS EVOLVED IN THE ARTIFICIAL DNA INDUSTRY. IT THEN GOES BEYOND THIS MOTIVATING EXAMPLE TO ASK WHETHER WE CAN EXPECT PRIVATE NON-PROLIFERATION STANDARDS TO BE SIMILARLY EFFECTIVE IN OTHER INDUSTRIES. NEXT, IT REVIEWS WHAT MODERN THEORIES HAVE TO SAY ABOUT STANDARD-SETTING IN BOTH GOVERNMENT AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THIS ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT PRIVATE STANDARDS SHOULD BE REASONABLY FEASIBLE, STRINGENT, AND ENFORCEABLE FOR MANY DUAL USE INDUSTRIES. FURTHERMORE, THEORY SUGGESTS THAT PRIVATE STANDARDS WILL OFTEN REFLECT SOCIETY’S RISK PREFERENCES AT LEAST AS WELL AS PUBLIC REGULATION. THE ARTICLE CONCLUDES BY SUGGESTING SPECIFIC REFORMS FOR IMPROVING PRIVATE AND PUBLIC STANDARDS-SETTING STILL FURTHER.DOWNLOAD

	WE DISCUSS WELFARE AND VARIOUS POLICY INTERVENTIONS FOR MIXED ICT MARKETS WHERE FIRMS USE EITHER 'OPEN SOURCE' (OS) OR 'CLOSED SOURCE' (CS) BUSINESS MODELS. WE FIND THAT THE EXISTENCE OF OS BUSINESS MODELS IMPROVES SOCIAL WELFARE COMPARED TO ALL-CS INDUSTRIES BY LETTING FIRMS SHARE COSTS AND AVOID DUPLICATION. HOWEVER, CODE SHARING ALSO ESTABLISHES A DE FACTO QUALITY-CARTEL THAT SUPPRESSES OS FIRMS' INCENTIVES TO INVEST. COMPETITION FROM CS FIRMS WEAKENS THIS CARTEL AND IMPROVES WELFARE. THAT SAID, MARKET FORCES ALONE PROVIDE TOO LITTLE CS COMPETITION. WE FIND NO SUPPORT FOR VARIOUS GOVERNMENT INTERVENTIONS BASED ON TAX BREAKS FOR OS-BASED FIRMS AND PRO-OS PROCUREMENT PREFERENCES BY GOVERNMENT. HOWEVER, POLICIES THAT DIRECTLY TARGET THE
	SUPPLY OF OS CODE HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT.DOWNLOAD

	THE NUMBER OF OPEN SOURCE (“OS”) SOFTWARE PROJECTS HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY FOR AT LEAST A DECADE. UNLIKE EARLY OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS, MUCH OF THIS GROWTH HAS BEEN FUNDED BY COMMERCIAL FIRMS THAT EXPECT TO EARN A PROFIT ON THEIR INVESTMENT. TYPICALLY, FIRMS DO THIS BY SELLING BUNDLES THAT CONTAIN BOTH OS SOFTWARE AND PROPRIETARY GOODS (E.G. CELL PHONES, APPLICATIONS PROGRAMS) AND SERVICES (CUSTOM SOFTWARE). WE PRESENT A GENERAL TWO-STAGE COURNOT MODEL IN WHICH ARBITRARY NUMBERS OF COMPETING OS AND CLOSED SOURCE (“CS”) FIRMS DECIDE HOW MUCH SOFTWARE TO CREATE IN STAGE 1 AND HOW MANY BUNDLES TO SUPPLY IN STAGE 2. WE FIND THAT THE AMOUNT OF OS SOFTWARE DELIVERED DEPENDS ON (A) THE DEGREE OF SUBSTITUTABILITY BETWEEN PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS, (B) THE NUMBER OF OS AND CS FIRMS COMPETING IN THE MARKET, AND (C) THE SAVINGS AVAILABLE TO OS FIRMS FROM COST-SHARING. HOWEVER, CODE-SHARING ALSO GUARANTEES THAT NO OS FIRM CAN OFFER BETTER SOFTWARE THAN ANY OTHER OS FIRM. THIS SUPPRESSES QUALITY COMPETITION BETWEEN OS FIRMS AND RESTRICTS THEIR OUTPUT MUCH AS AN AGREEMENT TO SUPPRESS COMPETITION ON QUALITY WOULD.
	COMPETITION FROM CS FIRMS WEAKENS THIS QUALITY-CARTEL EFFECT, THUS MIXED INDUSTRIES OFTEN OFFER HIGHER WELFARE. WE FIND THAT PURE-OS (PURE-CS) MARKETS ARE SOMETIMES STABLE AGAINST CS (OS) ENTRY SO THAT THE REQUIRED OS/CS STATE NEVER OCCURS. EVEN WHERE MIXED OS/CS INDUSTRIES DO EXIST, MOREOVER, THE PROPORTION OF OS FIRMS NEEDED TO STABILIZE THE MARKET AGAINST ENTRY IS ALMOST ALWAYS MUCH LARGER THAN THE TARGET RATIO REQUIRED TO OPTIMIZE WELFARE. WE EXAMINE VARIOUS POLICY OPTIONS FOR ADDRESSING THIS IMBALANCE WITH TAX POLICY, FUNDING OF OS DEVELOPMENT, AND PROCUREMENT PREFERENCES. WE FIND THAT THE FIRST-BEST SOLUTION IN OUR MODEL IS TO TAX OS FIRMS AND GRANT TAX BREAKS TO CS FIRMS. CONVERSELY, GOVERNMENT POLICIES THAT FUND OS DEVELOPMENT OR ESTABLISH PROCUREMENT PREFERENCES FOR OS SOFTWARE ACTUALLY INCREASE THE GAP BETWEEN DESIRED AND ACTUAL OS/CS RATIOS STILL FURTHER. DESPITE THIS, FUNDING OS DEVELOPMENT CAN STILL IMPROVE WELFARE BY BOOSTING TOTAL (PRIVATE GOVERNMENT) OS INVESTMENT ABOVE THE LEVELS THAT A PRIVATE CARTEL WOULD DELIVER.DOWNLOAD

	PATENTS DIFFER FROM OTHER FORMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THAT INDEPENDENT INVENTION IS NOT A DEFENSE TO INFRINGEMENT. WE ARGUE THAT THE PATENT RULE IS INFERIOR. FIRST, THE THREAT OF ENTRY BY INDEPENDENT INVENTION WOULD INDUCE PATENTHOLDERS TO LICENSE THE TECHNOLOGY, LOWERING THE MARKET PRICE. PROVIDED INDEPENDENT INVENTION IS AS COSTLY AS THE ORIGINAL COST OF R&D, THE MARKET PRICE WILL STILL BE HIGH ENOUGH TO COVER THE PATENTHOLDER'S COSTS. SECOND, A DEFENSE OF INDEPENDENT INVENTION WOULD REDUCE THE WASTEFUL DUPLICATION OF R&D EFFORT THAT OCCURS IN PATENT RACES. IN EITHER CASE, THE THREAT OF INDEPENDENT INVENTION CREATES A MECHANISM THAT LIMITS PATENTHOLDERS' PROFITS TO LEVELS COMMENSURATE WITH THEIR COSTS OF R&D.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER: SEPTEMBER 2019 (SEPTEMBER 2019)RESEARCH SUMMARY
IN LATE 2014, CALIFORNIA VOTERS PASSED PROPOSITION 47 THAT REDEFINED A SET OF LESS SERIOUS FELONY DRUG AND PROPERTY OFFENSES AS MISDEMEANORS. WE EXAMINE HOW RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CRIMINAL COURT DISPOSITIONS IN SAN FRANCISCO CHANGE IN THE YEARS BEFORE (2010-2014) AND AFTER (2015-2016) THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION 47. WE DECOMPOSE RACIAL DISPARITIES IN COURT DISPOSITIONS INTO COMPONENTS DUE TO RACIAL DIFFERENCES IN OFFENSE CHARACTERISTICS, INVOLVEMENT IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AT THE TIME OF ARREST, PRETRIAL DETENTION, CRIMINAL HISTORY, AND THE RESIDUAL UNEXPLAINED COMPONENT. BEFORE AND AFTER PROPOSITION 47 CASE CHARACTERISTICS EXPLAIN NEARLY ALL OF THE OBSERVABLE RACE DISPARITIES IN COURT DISPOSITIONS. HOWEVER, AFTER THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION 47 THERE IS A NARROWING OF RACIAL DISPARITIES IN CONVICTIONS AND INCARCERATION SENTENCES THAT IS DRIVEN BY LESSER WEIGHT PLACED ON CRIMINAL HISTORY, ACTIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATUS, AND PRETRIAL DETENTION IN EFFECTING COURT DISPOSITIONS.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS
THE FINDINGS FROM THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT POLICY REFORMS THAT SCALE BACK THE SEVERITY OF PUNISHMENT FOR CRIMINAL HISTORY AND ACTIVE CRIMINAL JUSTICE STATUS FOR LESS SERIOUS FELONY OFFENSES MAY HELP NARROW RACIAL INEQUALITIES IN CRIMINAL COURT DISPOSITIONS. EFFORTS TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF RACIAL INEQUALITIES IN MASS INCARCERATION IN OTHER STATES SHOULD CONSIDER REFORMS THAT REDUCE THE WEIGHT THAT CRIMINAL HISTORY, PRETRIAL DETENTION, AND ACTIVE PROBATION STATUS HAS ON CRIMINAL DEFENDANTS’ ELIGIBILITY FOR PRISON FOR LESS SERIOUS DRUG AND PROPERTY OFFENSES.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER: AUGUST 2019 (AUGUST 2019)WE EVALUATE WHETHER CALIFORNIA’S STATE PROPOSITION 47 IMPACTED STATE VIOLENT AND PROPERTY CRIME RATES. PASSED BY THE VOTERS IN NOVEMBER 2014, THE PROPOSITION REDEFINED MANY LESS SERIOUS PROPERTY AND DRUG OFFENSES THAT IN THE PAST COULD BE CHARGED AS EITHER A FELONY OR MISDEMEANOR TO STRAIGHT MISDEMEANORS. THE PROPOSITION CAUSED A SUDDEN AND SIZABLE DECLINE IN COUNTY JAIL POPULATIONS, A MODERATE DECLINE IN THE STATE PRISON POPULATION, A DECREASE IN ARRESTS FOR PROPERTY AND DRUG OFFENSES, AND A WAVE OF LEGAL PETITIONS FILED FOR RETROACTIVE RESENTENCING AND RECLASSIFICATION OF PRIOR CONVICTIONS. WE MAKE USE OF MULTIPLE STRATEGIES TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF THE PROPOSITION, INCLUDING STATE-LEVEL SYNTHETIC COHORT ANALYSIS, WITHIN-STATE EVENT STUDY ESTIMATES BASED ON STATE-LEVEL MONTHLY TIME SERIES, AND A CROSS-COUNTY ANALYSIS OF CHANGES IN COUNTY-LEVEL CRIME RATES THAT EXPLOIT HETEROGENEITY IN THE EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSITION ON LOCAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE PRACTICES. WE FIND LITTLE EVIDENCE OF AN IMPACT ON VIOLENT CRIME RATES IN THE STATE. ONCE CHANGES IN OFFENSE DEFINITIONS AND REPORTING PRACTICES IN KEY AGENCIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR, VIOLENT CRIME IN CALIFORNIA IS ROUGHLY AT PRE-PROPOSITION LEVELS AND GENERALLY LOWER THAN THE LEVELS THAT EXISTED IN 2010 PRIOR TO A WAVE MAJOR REFORMS TO THE STATE’S CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHILE OUR ANALYSIS OF VIOLENT CRIME RATES YIELDS A FEW SIGNIFICANT POINT ESTIMATES (A DECREASE IN MURDER FOR ONE METHOD AND AN INCREASE IN ROBBERY FOR ANOTHER), THESE FINDINGS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVITY TO THE METHOD USED TO GENERATE A COUNTERFACTUAL COMPARISON PATH. WE FIND MORE CONSISTENT EVIDENCE OF AN IMPACT ON PROPERTY CRIME, OPERATING PRIMARILY THROUGH AN EFFECT ON LARCENY THEFT. THE ESTIMATES ARE SENSITIVE TO THE METHOD USED TO GENERATE THE COUNTERFACTUAL, WITH MORE THAN HALF OF THE RELATIVE INCREASE IN PROPERTY CRIME (AND FOR SOME ESTIMATES CONSIDERABLY MORE) DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN THE COUNTERFACTUAL CRIME RATE RATHER THAN INCREASES FOR CALIFORNIA FOR SEVERAL OF THE ESTIMATORS THAT WE EMPLOY. DESPITE THIS SENSITIVITY, THERE IS EVIDENCE FROM ALL METHODS TRIED THAT PROPERTY CRIME INCREASED WITH, A BALLPARK SUMMARY OF FIVE TO SEVEN PERCENT ROUGHLY CONSISTENT WITH THE TOTALITY OF OUR ANALYSIS. SIMILAR TO VIOLENT CRIME, CALIFORNIA PROPERTY CRIME RATES REMAIN AT HISTORICALLY LOW LEVELS.DOWNLOAD

					WORKING PAPER: JANUARY 2019 (JANUARY 2019)IN THIS PROJECT WE EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF THE CASE MANAGEMENT AND TREATMENT DELIVERY PRACTICES DEVELOPED UNDER THE HOPE PROBATION STRATEGY TO PRETRIAL INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CONDITIONALLY RELEASED FROM JAIL SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL JUSTICE SUPERVISION.  IN THE JURISDICTION WE STUDY (HONOLULU, HAWAII), DEFENDANTS ON SUPERVISED RELEASE ARE TYPICALLY MONITORED BY PRETRIAL OFFICERS LOCATED AT THE COUNTY JAIL.  THE REVOCATION OF SUPERVISED RELEASE OCCURS ONCE A DEFENDANT HAS FAILED TO COMPLY SEVERAL TIMES WITH A SET OF PRE-SPECIFIED CONDITIONS, INCLUDING BUT NOT NECESSARILY LIMITED TO REFRAINING FROM DRUG USE AND ADDITIONAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY, MAINTAINING CONTACT WITH THE ASSIGNED PRETRIAL OFFICERS, AND MAKING ALL SCHEDULED COURT DATES.  THE INTERVENTION WE EVALUATE APPLIES RANDOM DRUG TESTING IN CONJUNCTION WITH SWIFT, CERTAIN, CONSISTENT, AND PROPORTIONATE SANCTIONS TO PRETRIAL MISCONDUCT.  THAT IS TO SAY, MISCONDUCT IS MET WITH QUICKLY ADMINISTERED ARREST AND RE-INCARCERATION, YET SUBSEQUENT JAIL SPELLS ARE PROPORTIONATE TO THE SERIOUSNESS OF THE VIOLATION.  THE INTERVENTION ALSO INCLUDES DRUG TREATMENT INTERVENTIONS FOR THOSE WHO REPEATEDLY FAIL DRUG TESTS (OR WHO REQUEST TREATMENT SERVICES) AND DIRECT INTERACTION FOLLOWING EACH VIOLATION WITH THE PRESIDING JUDGE OF A COURT DEVOTED TO HOPE PROBATION AS WELL AS HOPE PRETRIAL DEFENDANTS. BETWEEN SEPTEMBER 2014 AND AUGUST 2016, FELONY DEFENDANTS WHO FAILED TO MAKE BAIL AND WHO WERE GRANTED SUPERVISED RELEASE WERE RANDOMLY ASSIGNED TO EITHER STATUS-QUO PRETRIAL SERVICES OR TO THE HOPE PRETRIAL TREATMENT GROUP.  WE USE ADMINISTRATIVE DATA ON DRUG TESTS, REVOCATIONS, SUPERVISED RELEASE CASE DISPOSITIONS, AND CRIMINAL HISTORY RECORDS TO ASSESS WHETHER APPLYING HOPE TO INDIVIDUALS ON PRETRIAL SUPERVISED RELEASE IMPACTS VARIOUS MEASURES OF PRETRIAL MISCONDUCT, CRIMINAL CASE DISPOSITION, AND POST-DISPOSITION ARRESTS.  OUR FINDINGS ARE THE FOLLOWING:(1) HOPE TREATMENT GROUP MEMBERS EXPERIENCE MORE PRETRIAL SUPERVISED RELEASE REVOCATIONS MOST OF WHICH ARE BETTER CHARACTERIZED AS MODIFICATIONS BUT FEWER PERMANENT REVOCATIONS ENDING THE SUPERVISED RELEASE TERM RELATIVE TO CONTROL GROUP MEMBERS. (2) TREATMENT UNDER HOPE PRETRIAL REDUCED THE PROPORTION OF DRUG TESTS RESULTING IN FAILURE.  THE DRUG TEST FAILURE RATE FOR TREATMENT GROUP MEMBERS WAS ROUGHLY 21 TO 30 PERCENT LOWER THAN THE COMPARABLE FAILURE RATE OBSERVED FOR THE CONTROL GROUP WITH THE DIFFERENCE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT.(3) HOPE TREATMENT DID NOT IMPACT TOTAL JAIL DAYS SERVED BETWEEN THE SUPERVISED RELEASE DATE AND THE DISPOSITION DATE FOR THE CRIMINAL CASE.  HOWEVER, TREATMENT GROUP MEMBERS SERVE JAIL DAYS EARLIER IN THEIR SUPERVISED RELEASE TERM WHILE CONTROL GROUP MEMBERS SERVE MORE JAIL DAYS LATER.(4) AVERAGE TOTAL PRETRIAL ARRESTS OCCURRING AFTER SUPERVISED RELEASE DOES NOT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE TREATMENT AND CONTROL GROUP.  HOWEVER, TREATMENT GROUP MEMBERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY AND SUBSTANTIALLY LESS LIKELY TO BE ARRESTED WITH A NEW CRIMINAL CHARGE.(5) TREATMENT GROUP MEMBERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO BE CONVICTED AND LESS LIKELY TO BE CONVICTED FOR A FELONY.(6) WE DO NOT FIND STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT EFFECTS OF TREATMENT ON POST-DISPOSITION ARREST OUTCOMES.DOWNLOAD

WE DEVELOP AN INSTRUMENT FOR FUTURE CHANGES IN INCARCERATION RATES BASED ON THE THEORETICALLY PREDICTED DYNAMIC ADJUSTMENT PATH OF THE AGGREGATE INCARCERATION RATE IN RESPONSE TO A SHOCK TO PRISON ENTRANCE OR EXIT TRANSITION PROBABILITIES. GIVEN THAT INCARCERATION RATES ADJUST TO PERMANENT CHANGES IN BEHAVIOR WITH A DYNAMIC LAG, ONE CAN IDENTIFY VARIATION IN INCARCERATION RATES THAT IS NOT CONTAMINATED BY CONTEMPORARY CHANGES IN CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. FOR THE PERIOD 1978-2004, WE FIND CRIME-PRISON ELASTICITIES THAT ARE CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN THOSE IMPLIED BY ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATES. WE ALSO PRESENT RESULTS FOR TWO SUB-PERIODS: 1978-90 AND 1991-2004. OUR INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLES ESTIMATES FOR THE EARLIER PERIOD SUGGEST RELATIVELY LARGE CRIME-PRISON EFFECTS. FOR THE LATER TIME PERIOD, HOWEVER, THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INCARCERATION RATES ON CRIME RATES ARE MUCH SMALLER.DOWNLOAD

USING CASELEVEL DATA FROM THE U.S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION, WE CONSTRUCT A PANEL DATA SET OF AIDS INFECTION RATES COVERING THE PERIOD 1982 TO 1996 THAT VARY BY YEAR OF ONSET, MODE OF TRANSMISSION, STATE OF RESIDENCE, AGE, GENDER, AND RACE/ETHNICITY. USING DATA FROM THE U.S. CENSUS, WE CONSTRUCT A CONFORMING PANEL OF MALE AND FEMALE INCARCERATION RATES. WE USE THIS PANEL DATA TO MODEL THE DYNAMIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE MALE AND FEMALE AIDS INFECTION RATES AND THE PROPORTION OF MEN IN THE AGE/STATE/RACE-MATCHED COHORT THAT ARE INCARCERATED. WE FIND VERY STRONG EFFECTS OF MALE INCARCERATION RATES ON BOTH MALE AND FEMALE AIDS INFECTION RATES. THE DYNAMIC STRUCTURE OF THIS RELATIONSHIP PARALLELS THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE INCUBATION TIME BETWEEN HIV INFECTION AND THE ONSET OF FULL-BLOWN AIDS DOCUMENTED IN THE MEDICAL AND EPIDEMIOLOGICAL LITERATURE. THESE RESULTS ARE ROBUST TO EXPLICIT CONTROLS FOR (RACE-SPECIFIC) YEAR FIXED EFFECTS AND A FULLY INTERACTED SET OF AGE/RACE/STATE FIXED EFFECTS. OUR RESULTS REVEAL THAT THE HIGHER INCARCERATION RATES AMONG BLACK MALES OVER THIS PERIOD EXPLAIN THE LION’S SHARE OF THE RACIAL DISPARITY IN AIDS INFECTION BETWEEN BLACK WOMEN AND WOMEN OF OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS. THE MAGNITUDE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THESE EFFECTS PERSIST AFTER CONTROLLING FOR MEASURES OF CRACK COCAINE PREVALENCE AND FLOW RATES IN AND OUT OF PRISON. IN A SEPARATE ANALYSIS, WE EXPLOIT THE OCCURRENCE OF SYSTEM-WIDE STATE PRISON OVERCROWDING LITIGATION AS AN INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE FOR THE FLOW RATE OF PRISON RELEASES. WE FIND SHORT-RUN INCREASES IN PRISON RELEASE RATES THAT WERE INDUCED BY FINAL COURT DECISIONS ON RELIEF OF PRISONER OVERCROWDING RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SUBSEQUENT AIDS INFECTION RATES AMONG WOMEN AND BLACKS, MANIFESTING 5-10 YEARS FOLLOWING THE INCREASE OF PRISON RELEASES.DOWNLOAD
